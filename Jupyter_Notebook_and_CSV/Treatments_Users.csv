I received this little bottle of elixir pulled straight from the fountain of youth, and HOLY GRAIL! Although a tad pricey, a little bit goes a very long way. Having said that, this product does indeed do exactly what it claims. The first week of use, it most certainly did pull all of the impurities to the top and I have NEVER had such horrendous acne ads I did that first week. After soldiering through that nightmare of pimplistic proportions, my skin has regained its youthful, plump, amazingly soft complexion, AND I noticed an exorbitant difference in the fine lines on my forehead, beside my mouth, under eyes, and crow's feet almost immediately, definitely after 2 uses. Definitely follow the directions and only use every other day or it will dry thre crap out od your skin. This is now going to be a must have staple. LOVE!!!

I think I saw one of my fave beauty bloggers say she liked it... but usually I am always drawn to products that can claim they can clear up my skin. This does not promote that and that’s why I have been shocked on how smooth and even my skin has been looking!! I still have some breakouts but they are absolutely minimized. My skin isn’t as red. It appears less irritated and more hydrated. I am excited to see what I see after using Alpha H Liquid Gold for the next few months! For those hesitant to purchase, I have super fair, sensitive skin and prone to breakouts - no irritation other than I felt the first week it drew all impurities to the surface. Once those cleared, my skin has been totally different - in a good way!

Though it is hard for me to resist skipping on other beloved products, I followed the directions and used this alone after cleansing. I woke up to bright skin that was velvety smooth. I’ve used it a few more times and it continues to deliver. I am not sure what is different about this glycolic product but it WORKS and isn’t that all we really want?!

I was skeptical about this product because I didn’t have an sign of aging and dark spots, but I did have acne. The first few times of using it, it burned/ tingled but the next day, I had rejuvenated skin. I’ve been using my first bottle for over 4 months and I still got a ways to go. I recommend using it every other day for two weeks and then using it ever three days. I find that once I got the results of flawless glowing skin, I didn’t need to use it as much.

I received this in a sample and used it for a week and loved how it plumped and hydrated my eye area. I went back and invested in the full size as I have never really seen anything like this before. I use it day and night one pump is all you need and it leaves your under eye looking nice and hydrated. I purchased it about 2 months ago and I am not even half way done with it. My guess it will last me about 2-3 more months. So it is well worth the splurge. It does take about 5 minutes to fully dry down so best to apply it in your skin prep before you do your eye makeup. It does a beautiful job at prepping the under eyes for concealer and it isn't too heavy where it will change the texture of your skin.

I guess it depends on your skin type, environment ext but i found origins and tatcha and it saved my skin. I literally have clear skin and the moisturizers and hydration I need.

I do not have sensitized skin since I try skincare only 2-3 times per year, only to find out that the products, yet again, give me a rash. I use the Proactive ""Repair"" step one or twice per week. Lately, I've been mixing it with hyaluronic acid and marula oil. I find this particular Proactive line (not the newer version) to be extremely effective in fighting blemishes and controlling oiliness. What's most important to me is that I don't get an allergic reaction.

Prescriptions, Differin, Retin A, Salicylic Acid, Chemical Peels and NOTHING has helped my acne like Proactiv. I understand that some people might be sensitive to benzoyl peroxide and of course peroxide will bleach fabric but overall this is one of the more gentle acne treatments. The toner is very gentle and actually moisturizing. The Repairing Lotion is liquid gold and I haven't stopped using it in 20 years. Very luxurious product that will not dry out your skin. My nice just turned 13 and is going to have the same problems with acne that I did. She has whiteheads on her forehead and on her cheeks. I started using Proactiv repairing lotion on her and my mom couldn't believe her skin cleared up that fast. I'm telling you the truth.....you can buy all these other products on here if you want to, but if you want clear skin buy this. The combo of glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide is perfect. Salicylic Acid will not work on bad acne. Everybody knows about Proactiv for a reason. It works! I would just reccommend a good moisturizer. Proactiv's Green Tea is an excellent choice and while I use Belif Moisturizing Bomb, I always keep Green Tea on hand. My dermatologist even recommended that moisturizer to me and they sell medical grade products. It's just too light for me to use by itself now.

My skin didn't get that damaged but I could tell that it was because I got a bit of sun damage. I got tanned more easily which I HATED SO MUCH(I prefer being white because I'm Korean and all of my makeup products are light.) If you finish Number 1 and 2, then switch to a skincare routine to restore your skin's health and use 3 as a spot treatment. My skin is SO much clearer than before so this product does do what it's supposed to do. But I didn't like how it was drying and irritating my skin. Also, some people are saying ""OMG I GOT SO MUCH SUN DAMAGE"". First of all, it says on the product that your skin might be more prone to sun damage while using it. That's literally like the first thing I saw when I looked at it. So, you shouldn't really be complaining about that.

I have read some of the negative comments about people saying it stains their clothes, that their skin becomes addicted? Never have experienced any staining. And people need to understand when you use products on your face for quite some time those products will plateau out; meaning they lose their affect. So you have to switch up your face products every so often. I don’t typically write reviews ever but I wanted to write this one because I was mildly offended at all the negative reviews. This product saved my skin, not only did it eliminate my acne but it improve the overall appearance of my skin in general.

After reading the other reviews I agree this product does work for acne and it works extremely well for acne prone oily skin. However, I agree also, that it is extremely harsh. Even with my extremely oily acne prone skin using this system would cause my skin to become extremely dry and flaky. My skin is also sensitive so I found it best to use this system twice a day for a week then once a day at night then every other day. Then eventually dropping the other products and using the cleanser. (Using the cleanser alone is very effective for sensitive skin people). If one has extremely oily acne prone skin it is often due to hormones genetics and diet. To help eat healthier and drink plenty of water especially while using this system. Water helps. Although it is 2019 and I feel that there are better “clean” choices for skin care that don’t irritate your skin. But, I often go back to this system because I know it works for my skin.

I've also tried other products, but they just can't compete with this. This version of proactiv contains benzoyl peroxide which is pretty much the strongest stuff you can get for acne without combining it with other medications or getting a prescription. I have tried proactiv+, but I get better results with this version. Yes, it can be drying, bleach clothes/towels/pillowcases, and cause sunburns when exposed to the sun as other reviews have mentioned, but this is ALL WRITTEN ON THE BOTTLE. Just like how when using AHAs/BHAs and/or retinol, it tells you ON THE BOTTLE to wear sunscreen. All of complaints that everyone had didn't bother me because I expected it or I wore sunscreen like it directed me to. If it's too drying, which has happened to me, I just reduced my use (which, again, is something that is written on the bottle). I remember when I first started this, it got worse before it gets better. Took about a month or so before my skin started to get clear, and I haven't looked back since.

I was gifted this serum for review purposes and while I have been testing it for almost two weeks, it hasn’t been enough time to see long term results. However, my solid first impressions are that I really enjoy this serum! It’s lightweight and cooling while having just a bit of a slip so it’s perfect to use in conjunction with my facial tools. It’s quickly absorbs without any tackiness which made it perfect for my multi step skincare routine. I do see a more refined appearance that is more toned. Overall, I haven’t had any adverse reactions to it and look forward to more long term use to see the lifting qualities.

The first time I tried the treatment, my somewhat sensitive skin became red, blotchy and warm to the touch. However, the packaging warned me of similar type reactions upon first use which immediately put my mind at ease. After the third treatment, my skin had adjusted and was glaring up significantly less when washing off the product. The scent is barely there and the overall treatment time is around 3 minutes maximum. An easy addition to your beauty routine 2-3 times a week for tighter pores and a brighter looking complexion. I can’t wait to seen the overall results after the full month of continuous treatment. *Received this product complimentary*

One day for some reason I got it in my head that I needed to be using more natural products, silicone free and no fragrance blah blah blah. I convinced myself that the Estée Lauder that had never let me down was now bad for me. I’m almost 44 and I’ve had terrible skin for the last couple of years, spending tons of money at Sephora on “natural” brands. What a joke! Nothing works like this, and a few other tried and true things from Estée Lauder. I feel so dumb for straying. Estée Lauder for life!!! If you are reading this and debating the purchase, just buy it. The line is semi pricey, but your regimen will last a long time and the items are very reasonable considering the results you get!

I budget for Botox this year and I don’t even need it! Extra vacation $$$$. Don’t get me wrong, this serum is stupid expensive. That said, 2nd huge bonus is that it makes your skin feel like silk after applying it. Sooooo smooth. Makeup goes on like a dream and it does not make me oily! I love this stuff. Besides the price I can say that it has one more negative, it takes a lot t cover my whole face. This little jar only lasted me a month and most serums that size last me 4-6.

I had read an article somewhere, I think by a skincare chemist, that resveratrol is important in helping niacinamide to work. (I recall his saying that it could be topical or a supplement.) There really aren't that many skincare products that have it, but several Caudalie products do. I rely a lot on niacinamide in my skin care, as I have lots of sun damage, and it really helps that (I alternate using it with vitamin C, not at the same time, as I understand they don't play well together). I use this serum first, and let it absorb. It goes on so smoothly and soaks in pretty fast. Then I use my niacinamine or vitamin C serum. After that absorbs, I use a moisturizer. Also important to me about this serum is that is has two kinds (molecular sizes) of hyaluronic acid. That's popular these days, as it's supposed to be helpful in keeping more than one layer of skin moisturized. This bottle is just beautiful. It seems a little big and heavy for an ounce of product, but that's ok. Except it is a little much for traveling--wish it came it a travel size, too. This is a luxury product! Not for the faint of spending.

I’m pretty new to serums, but I’m 31, fair, and live in California so I feel like it’s time I start trying these things! For me, the results were subtle and slow, which was a bit disappointing, but is there anything that actually works overnight? I found that the biggest drawback was the smell. At first, it doesn’t really smell like anything, but then I realized it kind of smelled like canned tuna water. Kinda gross. Before it sets, it’s a bit tacky, but that goes away after a few minutes. By the next morning my skin looks a little less pink, but I don’t think I’ve used it long enough to really notice a huge difference. I’m still using it, so hopefully I notice soon!

I’ve been using a high quality moisturizer and cleanser for awhile which work fine but weren’t doing much for the dullness that seems to come with winter or for the redness. The vitamin C serum has helped a LOT with adding some radiance, and it’s made my skin visibly brighter. I saw some good results within a week or so of use and it’s gotten better with consistency. It’s a great component to add to a beauty regimen and really helps with texture and overall look! I did receive this free in exchange for an honest review, which is what I’ve left here.

Skin Type Normal",3 stars,"This is a nice entry retinol but has very little of the “wow” factor you hear folks raving about when they use retinol. It didn’t break me out or peel my skin (which other retinols have done), but it also wasn’t strong enough to show any discernible changes. I used this a few nights a week for a few months (used the whole bottle) with my regular skincare routine and saw minimal to no change in my skin. That said — I am very sensitive and can’t handle stronger retinols (differin, drunk elephant have both burned/peeled my skin), and this was very gentle. My recommendation: save your money on this one. A better alternative OTC retinol for sensitive skin/newbies is the ROC brand from the drug store. FWIW, got this for free from a friend who works at First Aid Beauty. I am not a blogger/influencer so don’t think I need to disclose this, but figure it’s helpful! I also never had acne/used Vitamin A and my skin is generally pretty good, with a few fine lines/acne scars.

This has helped knock back hormonal acne and has faded some age spots, and softened/REMOVED wrinkles. No, it doesn’t smell pretty, but I prefer that to irritating added coverup fragrances. I do have to dry my hands before using the bottle, but you’re not supposed to apply retinol with wet hands, so it’s not much of an issue for me. I’ve had no issues with the bottle/pump breaking, and it keeps the product fresh. I have dry skin, and I actually like the formulation. Yes, it’s thick and rich, but I need the moisture, and it doesn’t pill under my SPF lotion or with any of my other oils and creams. I’m not a huge foundation wearer, but no trouble with that either (I use NARS long wear). I will keep repurchasing this.

The one negative is that I can only use the product once per week (even thought I've been using other retinol products in the past).

I'm trying to address two different kinds of redness- PIE (red marks from previous acne), and also just a general red flush that's mostly on my cheeks and chin. Time will tell how it works for the PIE, I know that takes a while to go away, but I've never had something work so well to reduce the red flushed appearance! Previously I had tried rose hip seed oil and Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief Treatment Lotion, but neither of those made a difference with my redness, and the Origins product had a strong fragrance, where this one doesn't have a fragrance at all. I've been using this product for about a month now, but noticed a difference within a week. The only downside to this is that you're not supposed to use it with other active ingredients, so I use it every other night when I'm not using my acne-targeting ingredients (tretinoin, azelaic acid, etc.). Even using it only every other night, I notice a difference. It is an oily texture but sinks into the skin nicely after about 30 minutes. I highly recommend it!

I still use vitamin C in the evening a few times a week, and I think these work well together (not in the same routine, I use EUK 134 in the AM). I also learned through some research that it’s very important not to use this product with other actives in the same routine (I have been limiting my use of glycolic acid and lactic acid to evenings as well). Other actives on top of this product quickly break down EUK 134, causing it to become ineffective for the rest of the day.

I definitely have a new glow (I’m 22 years old). Saturday night I went out but before I crashed I washed my face and applied the serum. My skin looked amazing the next day. So amazing that I’m not afraid to include a no-makeup pic from Sunday morning of me lounging on the couch. Don’t judge my selfie skills. It sucks that I can’t use this with the Ordinary glycolic acid or even salicylic acid but I’d rather not risk it even though my skin isn’t sensitive. It’s oily but not greasy. Absorbs completely after an hour. I love the warming sensation but be careful to avoid contact with eyes. It doesn’t explicitly state that in the packaging but it does burn. I’ll be purchasing again.

I didn't see too much of a difference, but I do like the texture. It's worth trying out, but I wouldn't get your hopes up, if that makes sense. I wouldn't repurchase, as I do prefer the Resveratrol and Ferulic, both of which have a track record of efficacy when coupled with Vitamin C or Niacinamide, and can be used with both.

Some light zits became very problematic and even with careful care, damaged skin that was clear before. The small zits/skin irritation should outweigh the effectiveness BUT IT DOES NOT. Proof is in the photos that my light sun damage under eyes and on cheek bones did not reduce or lighten at all. Visible skin irritation and breakouts daily for 2 months is unacceptable for no results. I wish I could get a refund on this product.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"I gave this product a five star rating because of how much it has helped my skin. I have painful cystic acne and this is the only thing that has gotten rid of it. With this product it is important to use it everyday, twice a day. Morning and night. I sometimes even use it in the middle of the day because of my overly oily skin. This product has also helped with my skin inflammation, discoloring, and scarring. I have never ever seen my skin this clear. I wouldn’t recommend this product to someone that doesn’t struggle with sever acne, it’s definitely not for everyone. I would recommend though if you are going to try Proactiv Md, to give it atleast a month before you actually decide if it works for you or not. It takes a while for any product to actually show results, but if you’re like me I saw results within the first week. I could really see my angry cystic acne get calmer and calmer as each day and use passed. On another note I would also like to recommend buying the proactiv green tea moisturizer because the first couple of weeks while using this product you will notice your skin being dry and flaky, it will feel tight but if you have oily skin like me then that’s not a bad thing. Just apply the moisturizer both the oil control, which is an spf, and green tea moisturizer and you will be set. Then once the dryness subsides after about a month and a half or maybe less, you should only have to use one moisturizer.

The Pros of this kit is that it is excellent to dry up blemishes that come in a few days before an important day. The Cons, is if you dont use the kit every single day, it punishes you with a knarly breakout worse than before. Almost as if your skin begins to depend on the product. It also is very drying. I would recommend keeping a set in your closet for emergencies purposes, but not regular use.

The fragrance was a concern because I have sensitive skin, and have had problems with other SK-II products in the past, but not this this one. I think this a great product. It delivers on its promises. I can definitely see and feel the change in the moisture level of my skin. It is pricy, but this product goes a long way. I have used it twice a day for a month and it still have 2/3 of my bottle left.

I try a lot of various oils / serums to increase calmness, radiance and moisture levels - for my skin type, when I put them on at night over moisturizer it really gives everything a boost and balance. Lately I've been on a quest to only purchase ""Clean"" products, and while this one isn't on Sephora's list it is something worth making the exception. My life changed when I started to use it. A fresh, dreamy scent - sort of reminding me of my mother. The tiniest drop will be enough. Absorbs into your skin, not pillow. But most of all...THE GLOW. I've never had more radiant and glowing skin in my entire life. Given the price point for the full size, I don't typically use it every night but when I have on a couple occasions, my skin was so glowy that I honestly couldn't name a friend or influencer who looked more radiant. As someone with previous severe skin issues, I never thought this would be achieved on me. Truly legendary serum. I normally never buy products at even half this price point, and I will continue to seek out ""Clean"" glow oils, but absolutely feel the investment in this one is SO worth it! Magical.

Skin Type Oily",4 stars,"Spotlight on the Youth Revolution Radiance Concentrator (complimentary from Amore Pacific): Key ingredients are promising: White peony (antioxidant), vitamin C (brightens, improves skin texture), niacinamide (brightens), green tea (antioxidant). This has a dual formula with a specially designed bottle; you need to turn the top and bottom to get your dropper to pull from a mixed set. Experience is lovely: This is a silky liquid with a glossy, but not oily, feel. It sinks in quickly and layers well, since I used this in my AM and PM routines after cleansing and toning. This does have a very strong floral scent due to the white peony. Verdict is good, but not $250 good: I guess it was unrealistic for me to ask it for my face from 10 years ago, but that’s what I was expecting. It’s a fine product that gave a bit of a bounce and a glow after two weeks of twice daily continuous use, but I’d only consider a repurchase it if it were in the $70-$90 range. If you want to splurge on AMOREPACIFIC, I recommend starting with their Vintage Single Extract Essence (also gifted) first - that one has more of the green tea, is less expensive, and gives my skin a similarly supple feeling.

I thought this would add additional hydration for me. I noticed the first time I used it, my skin was burning and turned red but calmed down after awhile. I do have sensitive skin and need to be careful with new products. After using about 2 days, my face broke out in red irritated bumps, which a few of his masks have done to me in the past. I stopped anything I had not been using for some time, had to stop my actives, and waited until skin cleared to re-introduce again. After the bumps cleared up my skin was so dry you could see flakes. I confirmed with Perricone customer service on when to apply, and was told after serums, and before moisturizer. Same thing occurred. I tried once more and that was it, there is something in this that doesn't agree with my skin. He mentions the Rosemary as a major ingredient, which is a known irritant, yet it is listed so far down the ingredient list, that it is doubtful that caused the problem. It sounds like others are having good results, but I will look for another Hyaluronic product to augment my skincare.

The bottle for this is sleek and perfect for a clean skincare brand, with a matte black cap and pump applicator. I’ve had no issues with the pump jamming or causing product footage around the opening. The serum itself is a light peach color and has a very light scent that definitely reads “clean skincare” - it smells like something from an organic grocery store beauty section. I definitely feel like I’m putting a good-for-me product on my face. Out of the serum, the water cream and the essence (all from Primera) I actually felt like this did the most for my skin. The formula is not greasy or thick, but light and hydrating. I barely need a pea sized drop and the product easily covers my entire face and leaves it feeling refreshed and plump. I also feel like my makeup stays on better when I use this, a testament to it actually soaking into the skin. If I were to buy only one product from this brand, it’d be this serum. If you are building a skincare routine, start with this and perhaps the moisturizer and then add the essence later. A+ Primera!! *Please note I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. I can honestly say this brand/product was such an outstanding find and I plan to repurchase.

I have very dry, redness-prone skin, and this serum is very calming and super nourishing. It leaves my face hydrated, glowing and helps to reduce the redness. I find this serum to have anti-aging and anti-inflammatory effects on my skin. I put it on in the morning followed by sunscreen and also every night. This serum is my “magic in a bottle”. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it!

My redness had gone down and my face looked over all so much better. After about 2 months in and onto my second bottle, I noticed I was getting more clogged pours then normally. Clogged pours was never a concern in my skin and this caused me to get a TON. I would get little white heads and uneven texture because of this. No break outs, just weird texture. After my second bottle. I decided this was not worth it. I loved not breaking out and loved not looking like a tomato all the time, but I hated putting makeup on and seeing all the new texture on my face. This was the only product introduced into my skincare regimen for those 4 months. Now I need help with this texture!!! Darn!!!

I received this flora + bast, herbivore, and saint jane. the pros of the flora + bast are that it absorbs quickly, helps with my irritated acne prone skin, very moisturizing, improved skin tone and texture, the cbd potency, and doesnt cause any negative skin reaction. the cons are the smell (I like the smell of weed) but this stuff smells like resin or super stale weed, and the ingredients dont include cannabidiol. that's the reason that a knocked off 1 star. the best of the 3 tried is the saint jane, then the herbivore, then this flora + bast. if the herbivore was more potent, I'd rank it above saint jane due to the price difference even tho I wish it had at least 300mg of cbd. I went ahead and purchased the saint jane because I could afford it, but if the price is too steep and you want 300mg, the flora + bast is really good! I cant speak to long term use yet tho.

It is a much heavier oil, much better suited to a night time sleeping mask that a daytime, under make-up one. No matter how long I waited before applying my makeup it eventually left me with raccoon eyes by midday. At 55, I have fairly dry skin, not oily for sure. I saw no improvement in my dark spots. It works fine for a facial oil, but it's nothing special and definitely over-priced for what is does or rather does not do.

It’s done wonders at keeping my skin moisturized and clear from any acne bumps. The most impressive use of all is my mom got a slight sunburn on her face. It was red and hot to the touch but not severe, she spent too long in the sun and didn’t reapply her SPF in time to prevent it. I made her try some of the serum overnight and the entire red mess was gone by the morning, we were both shocked. Don’t hesitate to give it a go, it has exected all my expectations.

I am really disappointed with this product upon my first use, because the 2nd ingredient is Dimethicone. Since this indicates it's for evening use only, I put it on directly after my toner, as I tend to like to use my actives as close to the skin as is possible. However because this is so loaded with silicone, nothing will layer nicely over it, and I ended up with it pilling terribly when I tried to moisturize over it. Silicone DOES NOT belong in night time skincare. I don't need a silky smooth feeling before I go to bed. Under makeup? Heck yeah. But if I can't use an oil and cream overtop of this, it completely defeats the purpose for me. I'm sad I wasted a promo code to get this, and I most certainly won't be buying the full size. Kate, you can do better.

The price tag at $122 Canadian is quite steep imo.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"One of the best, most softening, soothing things I've found for my skin! The description hypes up the antioxidants, but for me it is the plant polysaccharides in this formula that make it such a winner. The bamboo sap and whatever else that makes it feel all silky like that. I have found few other products out there that incorporate good quality polysaccharide-rich ingredients and it's a shame. I can just feel how soft and slippery it is as soon as I put it in my hand and when it has absorbed all the way, there is no sticky or oily residue - my skin just feels SOFT and hydrated. It doesn't feel heavy and sticky. I usually put it on under moisturizer or sometimes I use it as a ligh weight moisturizer on top of another serum that is a little heavier. I had a big sample of this before I bought it. I wish they made a smaller size of this so I could carry one in my purse. Seems there is nowhere near enough alcohol in this product to dry out skin. I think the alcohol is probably what makes it easy to spread it in such a thin layer, but when it evaporates, I'm still left with this awesome layer of moisture on my skin, sooo... The alcohol doesn't bother me at all.

I thought that La Prairie was the end all be all, and I didn’t expect much when trying this. Wow, was I pleasantly surprised! I have combination skin which includes an oily chin and nose areas, with dryer cheeks and normal forehead. This serum works for my entire face! I’d grown accustomed to not applying products to my combination/acne-prone areas, so being able to use a product that actually works while not breaking me out is fantastic. My dry areas are no longer dry, and the rest of my skin is hydrated without being oily. My first bottle has lasted me two months of thus far, already justifying the very fair price. Thinking back to when I used to spend anywhere from $300-$700 on serums makes me cringe! My skin has never looked better since I started using this product, and I hope they never stop making it. It glides easily over my skin and spreads nicely. Two pumps is enough to cover both my face and neck. Like all AMOREPACIFIC products, the scent is light and fresh. I truly can’t say enough positive things about this incredible serum.

This is such an improvement!! And that picture was taken three weeks after starting this product. Murad makes another great product! Since I turned 30, my skin has gone through some big changes. I developed deep, painful, hormonal acne, all along my chin and where the ""beard"" area would be on my face. I was in a pretty bad depression over my skin, I had the breakouts, terrible redness, tons of texture. If I left my house without makeup someone would always ask me ""oh, are you ok? Your face has a rash!"" Then I found Murad. I started with this product. Im on my 2nd bottle, and I will never be without it. I use it twice a day, morning I use it after my essence and vitamin c serum (I wait about 5mins before applying this), and I use this on the nights I don't use my pure retinol. The results are nothing short of magical. I never thought my skin would look semi normal. The texture is almost gone, I only get breakouts around the time of my period and even then they don't become the painful mountains they used to, I don't get as many, and they don't turn into the aggravated pustules anymore. I'm only 33 so I can't say much about the wrinkle smoothing, I don't have many wrinkles except under my eyes, and I'm not putting this under my eyes. For reference I have combo skin, very sensitive, hormonal acne, rosacea. This product did not irritate me AT ALL. NOT AT ALL!! OH HAPPY DAY!!! I love this product and I love this brand. They are expensive, but I only get one face and I'm willing to invest in my skincare at this stage in my life.

If I'm getting a little bump its shrunk if not completely cleared by morning. I've seen an overwhelming reduction of breakouts with constant use. I also love that this fights wrinkles too.

I like that it gives me a feeling of my scalp being very fresh and clean after and the smell doesn't bother me at all. My hair stops smelling like it once it dries.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"This product is MAGICAL for painful breakouts. I actually won this from BoxyCharm when they pared with Briogeo to do a giveaway and when I received it, I immediately thought to use it to help treat the diverticulitis in my scalp. Then, I got a really bad breakout after a facial I received (my skin was purging like crazy) and trying to do anything in my power not to try and extract the blemishes (to prevent discoloration), I remembered I had this and that it can also be used on blemishes. So, instead of popping I decided to give this a try as a spot treatment and see if tea tree oil can actually help heal blemishes. I put a few drops on a wet cotton ball and added a little water on top to dilute it before applying it to my skin. To my surprise, overnight the blemishes diminished in size dramatically and about a week later they are almost entirely completely flat. I also usually run the cotton ball over my nose after I've spot treated my blemishes to help with the black heads and I've definitely noticed less congestion there as well. In the same time, I've been using this as a spot treatment on my scalp and so far I cannot speak on whether or not it has helped treating the diverticulitis entirely, however, it has helped soothe the irritation and I have noticed a drastic decrease in flakiness. It feels very cooling when applied to the scalp or skin. I usually proceed with my usual hair and or skin care routine whenever I use this. I'm currently using it 1-2x a day. I need to keep using it for my scalp as I am sure that will take a bit longer to show actual results but so far it is has become a staple in my hair and skin care routine. I seriously don't ever see myself investing into another blemish spot treatment ever again because this serious does the job and a little goes a long way! Pricey for a tea tree oil but I promise you it's unlike any other and completely worth the price.

I have acne prone skin as I hit the tender age of 30, and I really needed something that would exfoliate and not be harsh on my skin since I didn’t know what mood swing this new found skin breakout was feeling. I got this along with the cleanse. Both bottles lasted me two and half months. The real problem with these bottles is they are bottle caps and these end up leaking or worse, exploding on your hand when you give a little squeeze. As for my skin, the polish really felt good getting everything off. The cleanse, honestly didn’t do much. Felt like a clean and clear gel face wash. It has sort of this minty like tingling feeling after cleaning which makes you feel like your face is cleaner than it is. I feel like for the price, you can find something that does more for your skin and wouldn’t be so wasteful by the design of the bottle.

Never been writing a review anywhere but it did a magic to my skin so it’s worth saying a couple of words. I’ve always had a problem skin with a lot of acne, enlarged pores and dark spots. Used to go to my cosmetologist every week doing a lot of skin treatments which were helping a little bit but only temporary. Those who have a very problem skin understand how frustrating it is when no matter what you do and how much money you spend your skin still doesnt look good. I decided to give Lancer a try because of a lot of good reviews I saw on it. Have been religiously using this Polish Blemish control together with the cleanser and the nourishing cream and started seeing real changes on my skin within the very first month. I have no acne right now, my pores got barely seen and my dark spots visibly faded. All my friends are telling me that my skin looks so much better now than during the times I was visiting the cosmetologist. I’m very happy with the products and will definitely order more. Don’t hesitate to get the full kit and Caviar Lime Acid Peel as well, it’s worth the price!

I'm fairly pale with pink undertones. OVERALL: Fine to good, which is not enough for the high cost, imo

The next day and day after I applied it right after cleansing without mixing it in with my daily moisturizer. That same day I saw a huge difference and was complemented on ""my tan"" by people at work. The one thing I did notice is that where my skin is lighter and one single tone (below my chin and neck area) the result seemed more yellow than brown or tan. I use SPF daily, but your face gets more sun than your neck and most people do have a lighter neck. I just applied a little bronzer to the area to play down the yellow tint. Not sure if this will be the result for everyone, and it's not terribly noticeable but I felt like I could see it especially with my hair up. Also, it smells really nice. Doesn't have that tanning bed or tanning lotion smell. One pump was sufficient for mixing it with moisturizer, and two pumps worked when I applied it directly to my skin after cleansing.

It goes on beautifully under makeup, has reduced my acne hyperpigmentation drastically, reduced my acne overall (doesn't completely take it away, but am getting far fewer breakouts), and has significantly improved my smile lines. I put it on under makeup with nothing else over it (my makeup has SPF) and it provides great moisture without getting oily and it helps my makeup stay on all day. My skin looks so radiant and smooth. If I do get a small breakout, this stuff helps it to heal faster. I also put it on at night before bed. This stuff is literally on my skin for at least 22 hours a day. Worth the price and one bottle lasts me about 6-8 weeks with twice daily use.

This serum is refreshing and has a very nice citrus scent. It absorbs quickly into the skin and feels very hydrating. A little definitely goes a long way so less is more with this serum. I sometimes like to use this as a primer for under foundation because of the little bit of tackiness it leaves after applying but it goes away after you apply moisturizer, foundation, etc. I haven’t noticed any difference in the fine lines or wrinkles I have so that’s the only reason why I deducted a star otherwise the fact that this serum has made my skin brighter, smoother, glowy and even makes it worth it!

I have used so many acne treatments and masks and serums and they don't work very well for long term use or they bring a ton acne before getting -slightly- better. This is different. This is gentle enough for sensitive skin, but it is powerful! I have never seen such bright, clear, and non-textured skin in my entire life. I use this product twice a day, right after my essence, before any other serum. I promise you, you can see results in acne in just three days. It will calm your acne, it will slowly fade, and it keeps it away! The best part is, it doesn't dry the living soul out of your skin like any other acne treatment does. Your skin will be happy and smooth and hydrated using this! You can see texture results in about one to two weeks of consistent usage. I suggest using this twice a day, but you can get away with using this once a day too. The important thing about this product is that you MUST allow anything you put on before it (you should really only put essence before it, this should be your first serum) to dry completely before putting this on! You also MUST allow this product to dry completely before putting on your next face product on. It only takes 10-15 seconds for this to dry though, so it isn't like this is a long wait. I've been happily using this for a few months now and I am going to be picking up a backup soon. Seriously, don't waste your money on any other acne treatment, THIS is what you need to help your skin and acne!

I have dry skin, so I expected the salicylic acid to dry my skin out even more, but this serum is more hydrating than I expected. The serum did seem to help clear up some blemishes I had. I can't speak to any anti-aging effects because I have not been using it long enough to see those effects. Overall, I think this serum would be good for you if you are looking for a serum to help with keeping skin clear of blemishes or acne, but you are looking for something that won't dry out your skin.

Skin Type Dry",4 stars,"I didn't experience the dramatic or immediate results that some others did with this serum. I've been using it consistently morning and night for the past 2 months and I'm only now beginning to see a visible difference in my skin. I have very dry, flake prone, dull looking skin but large pores that get easily congested. I'm approaching the end of the 2nd month using this serum and I've noticed that my pores aren't as clogged as before. I wouldn't say the serum has shrunken my pores (I don't think any product can) but by being less clogged, they're less noticeable than before. The serum also doesn't dry out my skin which was my concern when I started using it. It does have a very strong smell though. If you've ever used tea tree oil, the smell is as strong as that. There's no tea tree oil in this serum, just a combination of Clary, lavender and citrus oils but the combination makes a potent fragrance. The texture is very lightweight, almost as thin as water, and absorbs into the skin easily and doesn't feel tacky. The serum is a bit pricey but after 2 months I've only gone through a third of the bottle, so I think it's a good value. I probably use half a dropper per application. The serum is so thin, fluid and spreadable that it doesn't take much product to cover my entire face. Overall, I do think this serum has helped my skin look less dull, smoother and brighter than before but in my case is was a process and not an immediate change.

The pros are that it is gentle, cleansing, refreshing, and light. I saw a reduction in redness and puffiness (due to breakouts) over time. I like that it comes in a glass dropper bottle too so you're not contaminating any of the product when you use it. It also has a very nice light and refreshing sort of herbal-y natural smell which is not overbearing or perfume-y at all. However, I did find some cons. I did find a small increase in oil production around my T zone (but honestly, it could just be my skin type reacting with the formulation as I have naturally dry skin) and a couple tiny red bumps form around my chin. I didnt find a significant reduction in shrinking or clearing pores. I'd probably have to give this product maybe a 7 out of 10, but again, it could just be my skin type not cooperating. I did enjoy the positives it brang though and I feel like this would be really refreshing during hot summer months! I think it would be fantastic stored chilled.

I have used this product for about almost a month now and TODAY I can see significant results. My scars have faded, It did not make me break out (which is my MAIN concern when trying out a new product) in fact my skin has stopped breaking out. NOTICE: that it took me about a month to see results. There was a time when I almost gave up on it and wanted to discontinue using it. I learned my lesson. I must always give the new product some time (unless my skin reacts to the product) I absolutely love it!!! and highly recommend it. It has a ginger-ish smell to it.

A lot of other physical exfoliants are too creamy, and I feel like they don't get the job done. Boy does this, though! I needed to use less than anticipated, rubbed it in all over my face (it is a burnt orange color), and left it on for about ten minutes (not in the directions, but I always love a potential face mask) and then rinsed, and my skin was SO. SO. SO. SOFT. I had a very, very slight orange color left over (probably because I left it on for longer), but almost more like a good glowy color after a long day at the beach.

The next morning, I did wake up with pleasantly glowing skin. I washed it off quickly because the cream did stain my fingers orange when I tested the product. I was worried about staining my face. The product instructions suggest to leave it on for about 1-2 minutes for a detox, but I wouldn’t recommend it because of the possible staining. I removed 2 stars because of the orange staining, and for the abrasiveness of the exfoliant. The product itself is beautiful, and left my skin lovely and glowy the next morning.

The pores around my nose and chin were disgusting and my whole face had an awful texture. I was afraid to exfoliate because of how sensitive my skin was with the drug but one of the workers at my local Sephora recommended this to me to get rid of all the built up dead skin. It is an absolute game changer. The pores around my nose and my chin are completely cleared and smooth and the flakiness is finally dying down a bit to a manageable amount. It really has retextured my entire face and made my moisturizer finally absorb. Foundation finally works on my skin again Thank god for this stuff!

I actually DO prefer the hyaluronic acid for my skin, the results are immediate. (I haven't tried their brand of it) This is the second item I've purchased from The Inkey List, I just don't see myself repurchasing. I also don't like that I can't tell how much I have left. It's pretty inexpensive for a skincare item so can't complain too much. And everyone's skin is different. It's more of a thicker serum consistency, goes on smooth. Feels ok, kind of a sticky feel but nothing bad. It's just not for me.

Since I was 22 (so over a decade), I would have red dry skin around my nose. It’s somehow hormonal because it would be worse around my period and while I was breast feeding my first child. About two months into using this product I noticed it was much better. Now about 4 months in the redness is almost non-existent. I also noticed that my acne marks heal much more quickly with this. Disclaimer: I’m breast feeding my second kid and haven’t had my period yet, and I’ve historically gotten 1-3 big zits each period. That being said, I haven’t had any major zits while using this product, just minor ones and the spots from old zits are gone. I’m really hopeful, my product regimen will still work once periods return. I’m using this morning and night, using micellar water to cleanse at night and neutrogena face wash in morning, plus drunk elephant moisturizer after I apply this before I apply makeup. I highly recommend, especially because it’s so cheap! It’s worth trying to see if you’ll get the same results.

Skin Type Dry",2 stars,"This stuff is a major disappointment so far. The reviews are all super, but the serum is not. For the very high price of a one ounce bottle, I expected at least some results after a few weeks. No miracles, of course, but something? Anything? I always regret straying from my standard Caudalie/PTR regimen. This serum is sticky, and stays that way. All day or night, STICKY. I live near a large, polluted city on the East Coast, so with Dior’s magical claims of detoxifying and protecting skin from ‘external aggressors’ like pollution, I at least expected a very clean feeling to my skin. But in the several weeks that I used it two times daily, my skin got noticeably worse! I am over 50 but have pretty good skin. Just fighting the age, with fine lines, larger pores, and a bit of leftover sun damage. But when I used the Dior serum, my skin actually broke out with cheek acne. Haven’t seen that in 40 years! I flipped my vanity mirror to Magnify, and was dismayed to see that it looked like my skin was sort of disintegrating. THAT has never happened to me. I guess fear of aging will make you do stupid things like pay $100 for one ounce of something you haven’t sampled before. It makes me feel even worse that this is sort of a pre-serum serum...it was almost bound to fail. Once again, I kept the faith and kept using it to give it a chance, so now I likely can’t return it. (I gave this 2 stars strictly for the excellent packaging. Dark, heavy glass bottle; nice smooth-action pump; secure lid.) When an expensive, designer skincare product makes your skin worse than it’s ever been, you know it is definitely not the ONE.

I did break out the first week, probably from the acid clearing out what was already there, but after that my face has been clearer than it has in months. I've been on antibiotics and topicals for acne for several years now, and now I've stopped using all topical treatments and lowered my antibiotics. I use the wash once a day with only moisturizer after. My face is pretty used to strong chemicals by now so I wasn't sensitive to the wash, but if you aren't used to acids then I would test this out first. I highly recommend this wash for anyone dealing with that stubborn infected acne. It totally works!

This stuff doesn’t actually help make pores physically smaller, it acts like a primer to put a layer of silicons over your pores which makes them look smoother. However once you watch it off, I found they were the same as before, if not worse. My pores on my nose got clogged when I used this and whiteheads developed which never happens to me, even with regular primers. I also found it was hard to wash off, for several days after I first started using it my pores were looking smoother after I washed my face and I thought ‘wow this stuff is really working!’ Then I started breaking out and did a strong exfoliating scrub and mask to clear up the whiteheads. When I rinsed the scrub off I noticed ‘pilling’ was happening - which was weird because my skin should have been totally clean at that point. I realized it was this product, still on my skin after an aggressive scrub! I finished scrubbing it off and realized that it had been on my skin all week, though multiple face washes and make up removers. after I finished removed it, I realized my pores were not improved at all, they were the same.

I have very ry ski and i also have very large ores on my forehead and side of nose. This is a MIRACLE worker for my skin. It will NOT get RID of pores, its not made for that. It will sublimate your skin to give the impression they are gone. They will contribute to diminish their size. You cannot get rid of pores, they will not get smaller as pores do not have muscles that contracts or dilates them. They will get bigger if they are clogged and not cleaned on a regular basis. so if you think this will get rid of your pores it is not the right product for you. If you want skin that feels amazingly soft and allow your makeup to glide over the pores - then this is the most perfect product for you. Not every product will work on every skin type or skin chemistry so please dont bash people for whom this works and dont be rude to them as well :)

This smells fantastic, it’s actually the only product that my boyfriend has ever commented on (he lives the scent too). I’m not much of an oil person because it makes me look super shiny and most of them seem to cause me to break out. This locks in moisture like an oil but doesn’t make me look or feel greasy and hasn’t caused any breakouts. My skin feels soft the next day even if I can’t attribute any visible results to the product. It is pricey but it lasts a very long time. Still, I prefer to buy it during the vip sale!!

It also irritated my skin somewhat every time I applied it(maybe the anti-aging product is supposed to cause tingling?). I don’t notice much difference in my skin tone after each use. However my skin does appear to be firmer in the morning , not sure if it has to do with this particular product...

It was always there but I feel like it’s just one that nobody ever really talks about, but as you notice they always have the best reviews so that should speak for itself. Oddly enough, somehow my whole skincare routine has now ended up philosophy. It all started with renewed hope in a jar that I bought simply because it was a good deal(facewash, clay mask, and spf moisturizer) and I absolutely fell in love with how well it worked. I pair this with the renewed hope in a jar every morning and I use the help me retinol at night. I honestly have never felt more confident in my ski even though I am now 33 and had hyperpigmentation from pregnancy and sun damage from years of tanning. I also had very dehydrated skin. I keep wanting to buy all these other “hyped up” products that others rave about but never end up giving me any real results but can only somehow take the leap with these. I’m so tired of buying and returning products or wasting money on things that were the new “hype” and I’m glad I stumbled upon this.. This line has truly given me the results I been praying for.

Have used for exactly 1 week and while putting on my makeup, I noticed the pesky sun spots I've tried to get rid of the past few months are very much faded. The first day I only mixed half a scoop just to make sure it didn't irritate my face. After that I have used 1 scoop mixed in the The Ordinary's Buffet in the mornings. My face looks a lot more radiant with this combo. I can't wait to see how much more my skin improves with continued use. Highly, highly recommend!

I only gave this item a 4 out of 5 because I can not utilize it on long days where I want to be shine free. When using this product, I tend to get shiny after 4-6 hours of wear; so I steer clear from this product on event days (weddings, etc.). Other than that, its great for daily use and it does have a slight tingling/brightening effect.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I've seen some reviews about people misusing this product. Before you buy anything new to put on your skin, ESPECIALLY a chemical peel, do your research on the ingredients. Also, KNOW YOUR OWN SKIN TYPE. If your skin gets irritated very easily and your skin needs extra gentle care, keep in mind that this is a stronger chemical peel. AHA and BHA are used to treat acne scars, acne, wrinkles, fine lines, discoloration, dryness, and other hard-to-battle skin problems. If you are just looking for a very gentle everyday exfoliating skin care item, use their 7% glycolic acid toner. However, if you are needing to get rid of hyperpigmentation, acne scars, wrinkles, fine lines, scars, etc. This chemical peel will work for you as long as you use it properly and always do a patch test before you put it all over your face! Read the ingredients and determine whether or not the peel will be too much for your skin. Keep in mind that you can use it much less frequently than it says on the label. It says you can use it twice a week for 10 minutes, but you can always choose to do it once a month for 5 minutes if you want to. It's all about how problematic your skin is and how sensitive it is. Me personally, I use it twice a week for the full 10 minutes and then I heavily slather my face with Cetaphil afterwards. Keep in mind that your skin will need extra gentle care after a chemical peel. No sun, no acne creams or acne soaps, no vitamin C serums or vitamin C creams, and no scrubbing your face immediately after use. You can go back to normal after a couple days and after you've noticed the redness has gone down completely. I always just use regular soap and regular cream on my skin after use for a couple days. This stuff works wonders!!

It is not really a “peel” just because your skin does not visibly peel and you definitely want to do it at night so your skin has time to heal plus it makes my skin VERY red (half because of the tint and half because I am very pale). Definitely recommend :)

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"I’ve never written a review for Sephora, but I figured I’d start because I ALWAYS read reviews when deciding whether or not to buy a product, so I greatly appreciate them. This product is fantastic. I have “good” skin. No breakouts, pretty small pores (because of my thorough skincare routine). But something that bothered me for years; very faint scaring on one cheek. I went through a horrible breakout spell after giving birth (I now have SO much empathy for people who struggle with acne, especially as adults). I use all high end, clean products. I exfoliate, moisturize, yada yada. I also use my BeautyBio micro-needling tool every day along with my Dr. Dennis Gross facial steamer (purchase both in Sephora’s website) to open my pores and get all that I can out of each product, as they aren’t inexpensive. *I HIGHLY suggest micro-needling & facial steaming. Really does make a significant difference.* Though I was pretty happy with the condition of my skin, nothing would fade that scaring. I used this mask ONCE after steaming, before applying my overnight products. I woke up and the scars were completely gone. My pores were invisible. I love Drunk Elephant, but this is SO much more effective than their ‘Baby Facial Peel’ for less than a fraction of the price. There are tons of AHA/BHA products on the market; this is inexpensive and it WORKS. Don’t mess around, follow the directions. No longer than 10 minutes. After rinsing it off I apply a mixture of Drunk Elephant’s ‘Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil (holy grail)’ & The Ordinary’s Lactic Acid 5% + HA. The Ordinary is legit. I was hesitant bc of the unbelievably low costs, but I’ve been impressed by everything of their’s I’ve tried.

I’ve been using it for about 1.5 weeks and can actually already see a difference. (My skin is definitely brighter!) It’s also gentle enough to use on my eczema-prone skin, which is pretty surprising. I don’t apply it to any parts of my face that are actively irritated or peeling. But it doesn’t sting, which is a big victory! I use it at night because I don’t love the smell. But I do think that the texture would be conducive to use under makeup if your skin is dry.

The most educated skincare experts say that the reason products like these cause breakouts is due to the fact that the ingredients are working under your skin to push out all the bad stuff first, which is pretty common for no more than two weeks. I have very sensitive combination skin and was fearful this would irritate me and cause acne, which it didn’t. Not everyone is going to find this product to be beneficial to them, and no product is suitable for everyone. However, your breakouts could be completely normal and will come to end eventually so just keep this in mind before knocking a product that could potentially work really well for your skin. Also Sephora has a great return policy so you can definitely try it out for two weeks and still get your money back if it still doesn’t work for you.

That’s just not possible for cystic acne. There’s so much that goes into it -what you put into your body being a big factor .. PROPER skincare for your skin type ..and so on.. I also noticed people claiming they have cystic acne when they just have one pimple on there chin. Cystic acne is painful. It’s embarrassing. For me personally, every time I thought my acne was going away , it would pop up somewhere else on my face and it went on for years like that. Nothing seemed to work.. I was so discouraged. Then I heard about the ordinary and bought a few of their products. Some of them I could do without but I found 2 that absolutely changed my life! This being one of them . I cleanse with dr. Bronners tea tree and hemp then the Niacinamide and then the Squalane oil . That’s IT. In a matter of days my acne was nearly gone. And stayed gone. I can’t believe a product could make my skin look the way it does for that price and in that amount of time. Another little secret for cystic acne is calamine lotion, and hydrocortisone cream ( just as spot treatment) not used together but overnight my cystic pimples literally shrunk down to almost disappeared. Thank you ordinary I am hooked this is an AMAZING life changing product .

I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and this product has been super nice to me. I wear it every single day as a first step of skincare before any Vit C serum. I usually wait 5-10 mins before layering with oil or cream as some products MAY pill IF used right after applying this serum. I would definitely recommend purchasing this if you have dry skin. it holds in moisture throughout the day (esp winter months because canada is brutal like that). After incorporating this in my skincare routine, and following up with oil/cream, I have never experienced dry patches on my face. my face looks dewy and moisturized at the end of the day. highly recommended!!

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"Do your skin a favor, ditch the expensive syrums and buy this! After years of doing unspeakable things to rid my skin of acne, I destroyed my skin's natural moisture barrier, leaving me with very dry skin (a fair warning to those acne prone ladies and gents, don't use harsh soaps and physical exfoliates! They will damage your skin and can actually make acne worse). After trying several different expensive moisturizers whose fragrance irritated my tired skin, I discovered The Ordinary. Out of all of the products in the line I've tried, this has made the single biggest difference in my skin! My skin is glowing and has regained its youthful appearance! I am super cautious to claim that any one product can fix your skin, because let's face it, that is an advertising ploy meant to lure you into buying more unnecessary products. BUT! There is reason this is used in so many face care products as a featured ingredient. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the skin that draws and locks in moisture from the environment. Unfortunately your skin produces less as you age. Many derma fillers are made using hyaluronic acid to help smooth fine lines and wrinkles. Syrums like this use molecules too large to really sink into the skin and rather sit on top as a surface barrier (still very important!) If you live in a dry environment, this may not be super effective, as there is no moisture to draw in to the skin and instead, it may draw moisture out of the deep layers of the skin. This can be helped by using other acids in your evening routine that target the deeper layers of your skin. I also highly suggest pairing this with a thicker moisturizer on top, as this is meant to mimic your skin's water barrier. You only need a small amount of this to spread a thin layer over the skin. If you find that it pills when adding other products on top, trying waiting a few minutes for it to dry.

I could take or leave this product in my routine, but do enjoy using it while I have it. I will say when I’m dehydrated or when there is really low humidity where I live, I don’t see that this does much for my skin. With how the acid works, it needs moisture in the air/surrounding area to work properly. Highly recommend a tip I saw from a dermatologist on YouTube: make sure to slightly wet your skin before applying to help ensure it doesn’t immediately suck the moisture from the top layer of your skin.

My scars are less pigmented than they were before (with daily use for about six weeks now). They’re not gone, and this won’t erase them by any means. But they’re less red for sure. More than anything though, this serum FEELS so good. I haven’t found another serum that almost “sets” onto/into your skin the way this does. A really unique texture and feel. If you’re considering it, at least go get a sample and see what you think.

Skin Type Normal",2 stars,"Having used numerous vitamin C products in the past (skinceuticals, drunk elephant, dr.dennis gross, etc.), this serum is a very gentle, inoffensive product that no doubt will work beautifully with sensitive skin or for people who are new to vitamin C. That being said, this was personally too gentle for me, and I did not see any changes to my skin. However, I also did not break out or react adversely to this product, so perhaps this is an issue of my own skin needing a bit more oomph. Also, Ole is not the only brand guilty of promoting this, but collagen molecules are simply too large to be absorbed via the skin, so do take any topical collagen claims with a grain of salt! If you are looking to boost your own collagen production, consider taking collagen supplements orally instead, and not relying on a skincare product's claims to do so.

Dark spots from acne scars have begun fading away, which was something I didn't think could actually happen. A little goes a long way with this stuff - I bought a travel size just to try and even after using every day for a month I still have about 1/3 remaining - and I find that it applies best immediately after washing the face. My skin absorbs it pretty quickly too, and it smells wonderful. I will definitely be purchasing a large bottle after this mini finally runs out.

My pores are a bit smaller and my skin is less red and irritated. The texture of my skin has changed for the better and my makeup goes on better.

Make sure to use a lot of moisturizing products and SPF while using this. Also, maybe try using a Clarisonic to buff away excess dry skin. After a few weeks, the peeling stops. If you can hold out the peeling part, your skin will thank you. I’ve been on prescription retinol before also from a dermatologist. AHA/BHA/glycolic will take away dead skin on the surface but without retinol your skin isn’t getting what it needs to stay looking young.

In terms of the actual product, it’s a somewhat sticky consistency but absorbs pretty well. It left a very minimum stickiness on my skin. The reason I am giving it two stars is because I didn’t see any visible difference after using this. Now granted, I’ve only been using it for about 2 weeks somewhat regularly but I had to stop it because my skin broke out like the constellations in the sky. It could either be this or the Niacinamide and Zinc solution that’s caused the breakouts but I have a very strong feeling it’s this serum because I applied the Buffet serum to one half of my face regularly and the zinc solution to the other side also regularly and the side that is currently breaking out is the one where I applied the Buffet serum. I would have maybe given it 3 stars if it had done something beneficial but I feel like my skins the same if not worse. Take caution if you have normal/dry, sensitive skin like mines!

I make sure all the gunk is out, clean the area with some antiseptic and then put this patch on. It prevents the open wound from developing a dark and hard crust, which takes more than a week to come off. It also calms down any residual Inflammation overnight. When I take it off in the morning, the redness and swelling are usually gone or very minimal, and I can cover up the area with concealer smoothly, without the texture making it more prominent. Overall, it makes the healing process much faster. Combined with regular exfoliation and azaleic acid, the post-acne marks remain red for a few days before disappearing completely!

These stay on throughout the night and prevents me from picking more, and I only have to use it once or twice for it to disappear! However, the do leave a ring around the area so make sure you wash your face throughly before applying makeup, I made the mistake and later saw the mark. I’ve been jealous seeing other people’s results from cheaper products like corsx but this is worth the price because it’s actually worked for me and pulled all the gunk out!

I usually put them on before bed and then in the morning, you can see where the bacteria and gunk is pulled out of the skin and onto the patch. I do sometimes use them to spot treat during the day, if something has popped up randomly. It’s also really good for reducing the swelling of my acne as well. Highly recommend. Note: I do have tend to have combination skin usually during the summer and more dry skin during the winter time. If you have oily skin, might not work as well. And I don’t usually break out unless it’s that time of the month. I’ve also noticed that if you pull off and try to reapply (if you don’t like where you placed it), it doesn’t stick as well so make sure you’ll like where it’ll be before sticking it onto your skin.

As an influencer I try many different serums, gels, creams, etc from many brands but Drunk Elephant’s B Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum has given me a new love! A serum moisturizer?! Still blows my mind in the BEST way! It’s light and refreshing and doesn’t leave my skin sticky, greasy, or icky feeling at all, actually the complete opposite and my skin looks awesome since I started and continue to use it! A little goes a long way as well as your serum you mix with it so it’ll last forever! Just to note...You do not have to mix it with another serum, cream, gel if you don’t want or need to and it works just as great for hydrating your skin! A definite must add to your skincare regimen!! I was happily surprised to see brighter healthier looking skin after the first day and then by the 1st week then 2nd week I was completely sold and will continue to keep this in my skincare Arsenal!

This serum and DE in general has solved what I feel are the root issues that lead to overproduction of oil (proper hydration, absorption, etc) and my skin has never felt so good. I can’t recommend the B Hydra Serum and DE products highly enough to those who have dealt with extremely oily skin.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I just have unfortunate skin. I’m in my 30s but have had acne (moderate/hormonal/under the skin) for most of my life. I’ve tried prescription topicals, diets, supplements, a myriad of face washes, skincare systems and spot treatments, adapalene, etc. I’ve tried almost everything. I think the issue is that my skin is not at all oily, but instead is dry and sensitive, so most acne products just make it worse. Then I found SKII. In combination with Shiseido Ultimune, used daily for about 3 months, I’ve noticed an improvement in texture/scarring, discoloration and dryness. My skin responds to almost nothing, so for there to be a visible change at all is incredible. I think it’s the fungi that are in both products, honestly. I highly recommend this if your skin is sensitive, aging acne prone. If nothing else works, try this. I feel like people who are blessed with naturally clear and generally balanced complexions may not notice much of change, but for those of us that continually struggle this is a godsend.

Skin Type Normal",3 stars,"I have consistently used this product for around 7-8 years now, so I do feel somewhat qualified to leave a well-informed review. There is a slightly fermented smell that is intolerable to some, but honestly fades within moments of application. It has a watery consistency and did keep my skin feeling soft and balanced over the years, always ready for my serums and moisturizers. However, the reason why I am discontinuing my usage of this product and only giving it 3 stars is that it is simply too expensive for what it is. The main and honestly only noteworthy ingredient in this product is pitera, which is a fermented product of yeast, with proven benefits to the skin (from limited research that was conducted by the company that owns SK-ii). And that's it. At less than half this price point, you can find all kinds of Korean and Japanese essences and toners that are packed full of other goodies like antioxidants, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is a great product! But after having used it for all these years, I do not think it is worth the luxury price tag. But if you do find yourself loving pitera, I would recommend that you turn to the SK-ii facial clear lotion toner, as there are additional AHAs in there (in addition to the pitera) to make the price tag more worthwhile.

I see a definite difference in fine lines with the Buffet serum and the HA moisturizer and I feel my skin had consistently looked better since I started this routine.

Now my eyes look less tired and, truthfully, some days I don't even feel like I need concealer. This was a great find.

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"I was skeptical at first, researching product ingredients and watching hundreds of YouTube reviews on how this product line worked for different skin types seeing as finding reviews with dry sensitive skin is difficult. The thought of having to spend hundreds of dollars for a product that might not work has always pushed me away from any kind of serum skin care. But I've found that this set along with the caffeine serum and the plant squalane works just fine (alternating between the buffet and retinoid every other day). I use a light scrub once or twice a week, applying the caffeine serum, buffet/ retinoid, plant squalane, and then CeraVe PM lotion before I go to bed. I've also found the moisturizer is more effective in the morning combo'd with a mineral sunscreen on the mornings after I used the retinoid. Otherwise I use CeraVe Am lotion on the mornings after using the buffet. So far in the last 6 months, I've noticed my under eye circles vanish and fine lines smooth out. The rough patchy areas (forehead, cheeks, and chin) are gone. I'll even use 1-2 drops of the plant squalane to prep my face before make up. I'm a minimalist when it comes to make up because I have two types of monolids and it can be hard to even out eyeshadow. So skin care, brows, and lips are my usual focus, but all of that can be destroyed by rough, flakey skin. I live in a continental climate where winters can be long and harsh, on the coldest weeks I'll switch it up and use the rose hip seed oil at night and the plant squalane in the morning before moisturizing. Before this, I hadn't really used serums so for the price it's a great intro to the skincare game.

When I took it off in the morning there was a film layer of product on my face and an oval red mark (that lasted about half an hour). The area of skin was hydrated but the amount of product left on my face makes me wonder what- if anything, penetrated my skin? A slide from the retinol in the patch I don’t necessarily think the delivery mechanism was a win for me personally. I used up the pack but will just slather on a retinol cream in the future.

I am glad that I chose Estee Lauder as I believe working as a hydrating and repair serum, the addition of alcohol and perfume in Lancome's is just ridiculous. As I am a fan for BHA, AHA and retinol, my face can sometimes break out and be sensitized a little. The day I applied this serum before my ""radical skincare ingredients"", I found all what concerned me before--acnes, sensitization, were all gone in just as short as one night. This serum does not clog my pores nor break me out no matter how much I apply on my face. It is so wonderful in fixing problematic skin issues and can hydrating your skin without feeling greasy.

I have very dry skin that can get irritated quickly. I have tried vitamin C serums before & I found them to be irritating (my face would sting or turn reddish). This one is great for me because it is mixed in with other humectants making it gentler & more hydrating. Other than dryness, my other skin concern is very slight tone unevenness (certain patches of my cheeks are slightly pink). In 5 weeks I found that this serums corrected most of that. Texture hasn’t been an issue for me, however after using this product, I realized my skin became even more smooth. I would recommend this serum to those with sensitive &/or dry skin types, and also for those who want a gentler vitamin C because they are new to the ingredient or because they are incorporating other actives into their routine. This being said, I don’t think this would be the right serum for those who are used to vitamin C and require something stronger.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"As a skin care junkie, I find it hard to try a new product and stick to it long enough to pinpoint it as the one true queen of changing my skin. I bought this months ago and that was the case; I tried it, it was nice, didn’t notice anything “miraculous” with inconsistent use in between using other serums that did seem to brighten and smooth overnight. Fast forward to last month when my skin had a *terrible* rash/reaction (not from this product) that I had to go see my primary care manager for. It was itchy, so irritated that I could only use cool water, and thus it became extremely dry and literally flaking off. After some medicated treatment, I was able to return to my normal skin care products and decided to pick this back up because I remembered how gentle it was. You guys...this stuff did work a miracle! I’ve been using it day and night for two weeks now and my skin feels softer than it has in my whole life, even before my skin rash. I’ve always had a little texture but now, literally nothing. It’s so plump and smooth and well hydrated but not at all greasy or oily. It works beautifully under makeup as well. There is no scent that I can tell and my skin has not been irritated one bit. Bottom line: it is not going to work overnight, like say, the Farmacy Honeymoon Glow. But in my opinion the honeymoon doesn’t produce long term effects. This product, I use one pump twice a day and my skin has literally transformed. It is a gradual improvement but a beautiful one nonetheless. I highly highly recommend!

Years and years ago when I worked at Sephora my skin was so bad mostly due to hereditary cystic acne passed down from my mom. I was so afraid it would keep progressing and that I would need to go on acutane like my mom. Something I was hoping to avoid at all costs because it can be quite intense on your body. Luckily I learnt so much about this brand and had many many colleagues tell me that this specific brand will do miracles. They were right! I have used the ferulic acid and retinol pads (night time), the original formula (day time) and once a week I used to do the medi-spa peels (same strength as Dr. Dennis uses in his office). For the past two years my skin was amazing. I stopped buying the peels because my skin got so good. Now I am engaged and super super stressed out about my wedding I’m having some skin issues again. I’m not worried though because I know that these peels will be a quick month or two fix and my skin will be all balanced again. I don’t work for Sephora anymore but if I did this would still be my number one recommendation for women wanting smoother, brighter, clear, poreless looking skin. Pro tip: you can cut the pads in half and stick the other half in the fridge and get two days. Or use the full thing and also use the pads on your hands!!! Keep your hands and neck as youthful as your face. Use the pad till it’s basically dry that way you get the most use out of it.

The past few months my usually tame (but very sensitive) skin started breaking out, leaving scars, and having noticeable discoloration- to the point I was wearing foundation every day so I didn’t have to see it (I’m sure that didn’t help at all). So in desperation, I started using these Dr Gross pads- first every other day, then daily. Now, after a month of using the pads, my skin looks great, scars have faded, skin tone has evened out, and I now love leaving the house without foundation! HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS PRODUCT: - The slight tingling sensation after putting on Step 1 may feel weird at first, but it’s expected since it is a peel. Like the instructions say, use the product every other day if it feels too much. - USE SUNSCREEN! This should be a given every day, but it’s especially important with this product. You can actually damage your skin if you use this product without applying skinscreen. - I personally like applying this product in the evening, but the instructions say you can use it in the AM / PM.

It’s like I got Botox! The texture on my face is a lot smoother. Step 1 does have a hard smell when I did it the 1st time but after it’s fine. Highly recommend this! I will for sure but again.

Even the packaging was not good ... the hole at the top is so tiny barely anything came out. I had to make it larger with a safety pin just to get the liquid to come out more than one tiny drop at a time. There is absolutely nothing about this product that justifies the price. Nothing.

However, after a year without it, I noticed my skin was not as subtle or plump looking... without “The Treatment Lotion” my skin was starting to look more and more dull over time. I decided to add this back into my routine. Within two weeks of using it again, my skin was starting to glow again. Not only was my skin getting it’s glow back, but my skin was looking plump again too. Plumping up any tiny fine lines that had started to appear. The texture of my skin was also starting to improve. I don’t know what I was thinking discontinuing this stuff. It’s amazing. My favorite thing about it, is how your skin feels the second you apply it. As it states it’s like an instant rush of hydration... Quenching any thirst your skin may be lacking with it’s fast-absorbing formula. Also, doing a great job soaking in your products, to get the most effectiveness out of your serums and creams to follow. I do doc one star, while the ingredients are great, the balance between the most valuable ingredients in it, to me, and the concentration of those ingredients, become diluted down in the formula so it can be made toner or an essence, making this a little over priced, value to dollar. BUT, there is nothing quite like it or it’s formula (or even how it’s “Miracle Broth” is made) sooo it’s still a winner in my book. Also: For those who are really concerned about what they put on their skin, this is formulated without Parabens, Phthalates or Sulfates!

To my surprise (and future financial dissatisfaction), I immediately saw results. Since then I have added this, the renewal oil and the perfecting treatment/cream. This routine has given me the best skin of my adult life. I started getting severe adult acne in my early 20s. With some diet changes (no dairy or eggs), I saw some improvement but nothing as revolutionary as using this skincare routine in conjunction with my beloved paula’s choice BHA liquid exfoliant and my HUM Nutrition regimen. I have never had perfect skin and probably never will, but if you are serious about investing in your skin, I would highly recommend every product named above. Let me not understate the important of having a healthy internal balance to promote healthy skin, but when it comes to topicals, there is a reason LaMer is considered to be the gold standard. Soothing, redness reducing, acne calming, you name it. I honestly will not and cannot go back from here. The gains have been too monumental for me, personally. In case you are wondering, this is the routine that changed my skin from textured and red to smooth and calm.

Yes, it’s true, and yes, it’s ridiculous for a product with such a high price tag to continue with a bad design after customer complaints, but people. Take matters into your own hands. If you don’t have a product spatula to get the last of a product out of the bottle, get one. The last 20% of this pricey serum is well worth the expense. Anyway.

No, it is everything they say it is. Lightened my healing blemish scars overnight! I loved it so much I splurged on a big bottle. The texture is similar to a face primer and the scent is such a dense lavender that I almost didn’t recognize it as lavender at first. Smell and texture aside, it’s worth the hype.

The texture of my skin is better and little fine lines are softened to the point of being almost invisible. It isn't doing much for dark spots etc but given the overall effect I have no complaints. The texture is a little 'dry' (hard to explain but a little like a heavy mattifying base I've used before) so it helps to have a 'damp' face via either a hydrating liquid or serum to help the concentrate spread out (or just use the whole la Mer system if you can afford it :)

They're also great for traveling—and they'll last you longer than you think. I stretched my first set out to two months even with everyday use, but was being very conservative with my pumps. I first apply an essence, then combine both serums in the palm of my hand and apply with my ring finger while my skin is still damp. The combination of the two helped even out my skin tone, and I do think my skin has looked more bright and less dull than before. I've seen a lot of comments about the C-Firma serum having a terrible smell, but I am very sensitive to scent and have honestly never noticed the smell of either product.

I noticed not too long after use that my skin felt tighter and more plump, and after a while I noticed my skin tone evening out. The B-Hydra serum is incredibly hydrating for a little serum! I use this while I’m applying an exfoliating product, such as the DE T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night serum. Neither of these products broke out my skin, which most do.

I'm not saying it is a miracle worker for pimples, but it certainly helps reduce the redness and then lightens the scarring afterwards. To be fair, I have not tried other products for dark spots but this has been working well for me regardless.

So I figured I’d try a company that seems to center itself around clean ingredients! I don’t know if I was just missing something, but I figured this was the same type of deal as isle or paradise where you apply it then night before and let it develop.. eventually I realize no, you add it each morning and it’s a one day wear type of thing. It definitely gives a nice glow and really evens out my skin tone! I wear concealer on top and everything looks put together which is nice! It also hasn’t broken me out at all which I love! Just make sure you use lotion (nothing fancy. Cerave from Walmart works great) and mix and rub in well! Give it a second to settle because initially it looks a little orange but after a few seconds it evens itself out great.

It’s also super great on your face and has a bunch of antioxidants. Mix half a pump in with your foundation to look like maybe you saw the sun in the last day or two (winter is the worst).

I purchased this in part because it stated ""oil free,"" however, the 2nd ingredient caprylic triglyceride is pretty much an oil as far as I've been able to research. This does tend to have a slightly heavier feel on the face, but it does absorb pretty well. I'm relegating this to night time only use, on very dry skin days for now.... On the plus side, it is very affordable, and I actually quite like it as a hand creme, if nothing else.

The product itself is pretty watery but once applied, it becomes tacky and gradually sinks into your skin. I found that this product also helps with keeping my skin moisturized (in addition to my moisturizer), and it goes great under makeup as well.

Day one my skin was hydrated and luminous, not oily. It applies like a dream. I wish all my products felt this good. I had gotten used to being disappointed by high-end skin care that don’t perform well on oily skin but this has actually delivered tangible results. I’ve been using it consistently day and night for two weeks and my skin is still hydrated and luminous but also fine lines are blurred, pores seem smaller, my overall texture seems more even. I’m sure some of my other products have definitely aided in all the improvements I’ve seen but I’m positive Genifique has helped my other products work more effectively. My acne scars have also significantly faded and I haven’t had the same kind of breakouts since. The price is steep but well worth every penny. I am more than happy to pay for a product that delivers on its promises. Thank you, Lancôme!!!

Applied again the next morning and am amazed by the change in texture on my forehead. Fine wrinkling and loose skin have disappeared in 2 applications. I used this under Protini and Lala Retro moisturizers. I plan on updating this review after the bottle is empty and I buy a new one (it seems a lot of people have better results with the sample than the retail bottle?).

However, once you can get past the horrible lavender smell this stuff is a miracle oil. Everyone I know has raved about this product for years, and I received a free sample and I figured I would try it out, and I liked the results from the week the sample lasted so I decided to invest in a whole bottle of it. I have been using it for around 3 months now! I have an almost natural redness to my skin that I have always associated with having very sensitive skin. Like washing my face with just water will make my face red. Even with like the gentle dermatologist recommended CeraVe face wash, my face is red for like 15 minutes afterwards. I have noticed with continued use of this MRC that my face is much less red and irritated by other products. I love that when I wake up my face is even toned and glow-y. My skin is very dry in the winter, and this has helped prevent and get rid of all of my dry patches. I am excited to try the Daily Reviving Concentrate since that smell is citrus so I will likely actually enjoy that smell! My only concern is that this will end up being a winter only product since my skin is so oily in the summer. But I am used to having different products in the summer months than I use for the winter months. The only other important thing I would as about this oil is that if you have any big blemishes coming out, just know this will make them come out much faster but also it will make their life much shorter which is definitely a plus.

I got rid of most of my acne when knfkrst started using this so if you have severe acne, I'm not sure if this is the product for you regarding active breakouts not because it would make it worse, but it may not do anything for an actual breakout. for me, it's good for the hyperpigmentation and old bumps from previous pimples and keeping pores clean. I use it every night. miracle.

I have spent so much money on primers...but even with oily skin, I have to say this is amazing. Especially under my eyes, and on my smile lines and forehead lines. It gives my skin a natural glow and sits under my foundation (I’ve been back to using bare minerals original powder lately) BEAUTIFULLY. As I’m getting older, I want to have a more natural, glowy look and this serum stick is helping me achieve that. It doesn’t cancel my lines but softens everything and gives me a glow. It helps with dryer under eyes too and my concealer sits beautifully on top of it.

However, this product has SAVED my skin this winter and I want to share it with anyone who might be struggling with the same concerns. I usually struggle with eczema in the winter, but I’ve never had it on my face before this year. I tried LITERALLY every different eye cream and from December to The middle of January nothing helped me heal my eyes at all. I started using this out of desperation when my eyes repeatedly peeled from brows to lashes and I was red and raw. I use it like a lip balm for the eye lid, and keep it in my purse to reapply when they are getting sore and itchy. It’s been a few weeks now and my eczema is healed! I only use it at night time now, and once in the morning to keep them looking great!

So a great bargain for an expensive brand.) I love that the set is great to travel with, and I was impressed at how long the products actually did last. I stretched my first set out to two months, but was being very conservative with my pumps. Overall, I would say I like this product, but I don't love it. I do think it helps even out my skin a little, but I haven't been blown away by the results. The products also leave behind a tacky residue that makes me feel like the product isn't being properly absorbed by my skin. I've repurchased this product before, but am now looking into alternative products as I feel like there might be something better out there.

I really love what the Rise Glow set does for my skin (I’m lucky enough not to be allergic/sensitive to vit C). But this set has had almost no effect on my skin. The oil feels too heavy for my skin to absorb. The serum has a similar problem as the one in the Rise set, where it dries too tacky for my taste. Having used other DE products before, I can only assume that these two products just don’t work for me. Will probably skip out on repurchasing this one and save up for the fullsized vit C serum they have.

She recommended this product, and after a few weeks, I could see all my dark spots start to disappear. I had never felt more beautiful, honestly. I also used Caudalie's moisturizer, essence, and beauty elixir. All products worked nicely with this serum as well. The only reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because of the price.

I compared this to microdermabrasion I had when I was younger. Minus the bleeding of course. It has a familiar scent I cannot place from my childhood. Something I knew in Italy as a product perhaps. I like when you exfoliate, and feel a sensation like you actually did something. It tingles and my face goes red for a little while and then feels the softest it has ever been. I cannot get these results with anything else. Mary Kay exfoliation comes close to it minus the ingredients you get in this. The price is what I cannot get past. I got mine in a subscription box. I have to hope to get it again in this form because $120 is just too much.

Smoother more radiant skin. I wanted my skin to look refreshed and glowing. I take my skin care a bit more serious now that I’m in my 30’s. What I got... my skin felt soft. No glow, no radiance.

Make sure you are used to retinol before using this product as it contains quite a high amount otherwise you may get little whiteheads. Its very lovely paired with the juno oil. I give the retinol about 30 minutes to set into my skin then apply the juno oil as a moisturizer.,https://www.sephora.com/product/a-high-dose-retinoid-serum-P440075?icid2=products%20grid:p440075

I have some dark spots on my face due to acne, and the fact that my skin tone is brown. I applied these patches on my face and left them sit for the appropriate amount of time. After my two weeks of using this product, I noticed that the areas on my face where I have dark spots seemed to fade a little bit, although it was still a bit noticeable.

Each package has 12 dots, separated into two packets. I noticed that when I used 3 dots and saved the other 3 for a few days later (you're supposed to use it twice per week), the microneedles went dull. So I purchased 2 more packages, and decided to use all 6 dots on my face at a time, to make sure that the dots didn't use their effectiveness. I followed the instructions and applied them after washing my face, and left them on overnight. I did the treatment twice per week, first with 3 dots x 4. Then when I got the other two packages, I did 6 dots at a time x 4 treatments. Despite that, I didn't notice any difference.

I bought the large bottle, and scooped up another one during a sale as my first bottle neared the end. After all that, I have my doubts that it’s even doing anything. For example, I rarely travel with it, re: the big bottle, and never really see a difference when I go without it for 2-3 weeks. Also, during times when I’ve had active inflammation and sensitivity on my skin, using this doesn’t help. I have to switch to a super gentle moisturizer; if I keep using this on inflamed skin it doesn’t heal. So why did I get a second bottle in the first place? I don’t know. My skincare is primarily preventative, and having this step to strengthen my skin barrier seems like a good idea. A lot of it comes down to the trust i have in shiseido. I’m 35, trying to take great care of my skin. This product has unique claims and ingredients. If this helps me maintain healthy skin for years to come, it will have been well worth it.

Parts of my skin that were more prone to dryness started shedding skin cells again recently. Although it could be related to other products I use, when you look at the ingredient list, denatured alcohol is the 2nd ingredient! That's a big no-no when it comes to skincare. None of my other products had the simple alcohols anywhere in the top 5 ingredients. In fact alcohol alone shows up again much later in the list. Really?? If you claim to restore the skin barrier, you should not have any simple alcohols in your ingredient list. Feeling duped. Otherwise, nice bottle and initial silky finish. It didn't ruin my skin so it isn't 1 star review. But if you care about your skin in the long run, this is the product to avoid.

Not bad acne but always a few pimples or some kind of break out going on with lots of redness. i noticed in those 2 weeks that pimples were going away and no new ones were popping up. Then i started noticing my redness subsiding which is also HUGE for me. i'm the kind of person where skin care that works amazing on everyone else makes my skin 10x worse. i have been on the hunt for a good oil and i FINALLY found it after years of searching. i ordered a full size bottle which is a huge bottle last week. I also finally found a good face wash and moisturizer so i have a great skin care routine going on now which is a miracle in it's self.. Today i have not 1 pimple on my face and my redness is getting better and better by the week. if you have REALLY dry skin your gonna need to pair this with a good hydrating moisturizer. This oil sinks into the skin so beautifully. The skin literally just drinks it up. You could use this even if you have oily skin. i would say it's good for ALL skin types including acne prone and extremely sensitive skin. This oil has become my holy grail and i will never be without it. i also ordered a travel size cleansing oil which is very good. Def need to pick up the full size bottle. i like to double cleanse so i go in with my normal cleanser afterwards. It has a very faint scent which goes away almost instantly after application. Trust me give this a try. i never write reviews because nothing ever works for me and i ALWAYS try and buy high end skin care. This stuff is liquid gold!

There is a greasy feeling at first but then it quickly turns into a smooth feeling as your skin starts to absorb it. But now I don’t think it’s worth the price. I’m towards the end of my bottle and still can’t really tell what this has done to improve my skin. Also, the dropper is too small and can’t reach the bottom of the bottle. The dropper is also cheap. Eventually the plastic squeezer came off and I had to start pouring the oil into my hand. This isn’t the packaging you expect for $70+.

A few months later and I finally decided to give this a try and omggg the results were amazing. My face is moisturized but not greasy, the dark spots are slowly fading, I also had dry cracked peeling sensitive lips (really gross like as if I was doing meth) used a humidifier but it only dried them out worse, nothing worked for months! I also had a bald patch on my eyelashes from curling them daily then one day I got too aggressive and ripped off a bunch! I noticed after a few months of applying this oil to my lips and eyes as serum that my lashes have grown so fast and they curl up now!

I decided to give it one more shot earlier this week and used it for just one night. The next day, even after cleansing my face in the morning, I had a bunch of small bumps on my chin and above my mouth that I knew were going to explode into pimples. I could also tell that my skin was producing excess sebum. That night I used a couple of tea tree-containing products and Murad’s Acne Control Clarifying Mask in an attempt to head off what seemed to be a massive breakout, and fortunately that did the trick. But the Vitamin C Rose Oil went in the trash. Never again.

I left it on for just under 20 minutes, washed it off, applied a ceramide night cream, slept, and woke up with a baby fresh face. I will definitely be adding this to my regime. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it’s BHA is willow bark extract, which is not a BHA nor is it as effective as one. So this may be misleading to people. Despite this it works as well as it looks.

So, I have to moisturize more after I use this, so I don’t wake up with dry skin. It helped with the swelling of my breakouts after picking and my pores now look smaller. I typically put it on in the shower after washing my face, so the steam opens up my pores for it to really work. After it’s been on for about thirty minutes I wash it off and then use my toner, serums, and moisturizers. It’s one of the few products that helped my acne and pore size, but didn’t instead just leave me with red irritated skin. This definitely gets five stars from me.

However, I find that no matter how much I spend blending it out, it leaves a white cast on my face which is why I didn't give it five stars. Plus it mattifies the skin so much that it can emphasize texture so I would recommend exfoliating and making sure you let your moisturizer hydrate for at least 30 min before putting it on. I definitely would recommend though!

My skin has been going through some rough changes ever since I hit my 30's. I would need to use oil blotting sheets on my skin at least twice a day if not more. This serum has worked wonders on my skin. The serum goes a long way; only a few drops covered my entire face. My cc cream applied amazingly on top of the serum; it actually gave it a matte finish! I didn't use any blotting sheets the entire day. By evening, my skin was not nearly as shiny or oily as it usually is by that time. I am still working on improving my skincare routine to help lessen my oil production, but this product will certainly help in the interim. I highly recommend this miracle product. It's a bit pricey imo, but it should go a long way. It's worth it!

However, I actually noticed a significant difference in how it controlled my oils throughout the day and helped hold my makeup in place. I think there is also a bit of pore blurring that this offers. Overall, if you don’t mind the price and are looking for something to help with shine, this did a pretty good job! Now it didn’t keep me matte all day by any means, but I was definitely not as shiny as I usually get throughout the day.

The only qualm I have is that it is not really a lotion and I feel like I waste some product when I apply. It is very liquidy (think of it more like a soothing toner with moisturizing properties). I apply this after washing my face and then top with my regular moisturizer. It is a great in between to soothe my skin and I do feel like it adds moisture and suppleness. I have completely skipped moisturizer after and unless it is a particularly dry day (aka winter) I feel like my skin is hydrated enough. Some reviews say there is a scent... I honestly don't notice one and have a pretty sensitive sense of smell.

I was scared to go beyond a basic day/night cream due to my fear of breaking out but after reading reviews decided to give Dior Capture Youth a try. YOU GUYS. THIS IS THE TRUTH. Been using for 2 weeks (not every day, just when my skin needs it) and omg the difference is crazy. Dark spots are reducing. Texture is better and pores are diminished. It moisturizes but truly stays matte creating a wonderful base for makeup. If you break out you need this serum.

It would start pretty red, and than dry out and flake of. Still unsure what provoked it but only thing that seemed to have helped at that time was heavy duty prescription hormonal ointmnet (much heavier than hydrocortisone). Wanting to go off of hormona stuff I was looking for a good mask in hopes it will take care of it. Based on research of ingredients and reviews I got this mask a while ago (5 months plus), and used as directed for a few weeks. It did have small effect on my pores but nothing to be crazy about. So ive neglected this product for a bit. Last month I came across blogger's article which said that, basically, certain masks (especially of peeling or resurfacing categories) should be really left on for an hour or more, depending on skin's sensitivity. I decided to give this mask another go but leave it on for much longer and ...holy mother of god, my pimple-like rash started to heal and is almost gone! My skin overall looks better, I wouldnt say it has retexturized it completely but its on its way. CONCLUSION: I think the KEY(and only if you can handle it, at your own risk and discretion) is to try leaving it for a longer period of time , and use it every 2nd or 3rd day consistently.Dont have to use a lot of it either (learned it the hard way) but thin layer will suffice.

Everything from the application and scent (herbally floral, but not too much), to the warming sensation during the masking, to the final product is exactly as promised. It's lovely and has become a staple in my Sunday evening routine. Love!! The only thing I was worried about was that it started to turn less blue and more green over time, but as Herbivore says right in the product description, this is normal and doesn't affect the efficacy of the mask.

Skin Type Dry",4 stars,"I love squalene oil, but I find this particular formula to be a bit too greasy. Squalane oil is a hydrogenated version of squalene, a compound produced naturally by our sebaceous glands. By our mid-20s we start to produce less squalene, necessitating topical application. Squalane squeezes between the skins layers to smooth the skin and lock in moisture. If your skin already produces too much sebum (aka you have oily skin), I would steer clear of this one. If you are like me, however, and have destroyed your skin's water barrier and natural sebum production from overzealous exfoliating and harsh face washing, squalane oil can help you re-establish your skin's moisture barrier. I find this particular formula to be a bit too greasy, even for my super dry skin and I had a couple break outs when I first introduced the product. It also takes a long time to sink into the skin, so I would recommend only using it as part of your pm routine. Despite that caveat, I continue to use this on the parts of my face that tend to be drier and avoid my t-zone. I have seen a noticeable difference around my eyes: no longer puffy (a sign of dehydration) and a reduced appearance of fine lines. This is also offered at a really great price point.

I chose this product for its great reviews and the unbeatable price. It hydrates exceptionally well and doesn't look greasy after you give it a little time to sink in. My only issue with this product is that it ""pills"" when I apply it over my retinol serum in the evening. The label says to apply after water-based treatments, and my retinol serum is indeed water-based. I read that some oils can pill over silicone-based products, but there is no silicone in my retinol serum. When I apply it over my vitamin C serum in the morning, I never experience pilling. Because I will probably run out of retinol before I run out of this, I'll try a different retinol serum with this oil and see if that works better. Just wanted to make potential buyers aware of the pilling issue, since I didn't see it in any reviews before I bought it.

I normally do a 5 to 10 step skin routine, and with so many products on my face, I don't think the Squalane could really get down into my skin. However, I recently went on vacation and my skin freaked out from all the dry, cold weather and stress. But then, when I got home, I used this product by itself and WOW!!! All my skin dryness went away! This product is a life saver for dry skin!

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"This is a hidden gem! It locks in moisture with a super light and smooth barrier. I’ve been adding a drop or two to my moisturizer after applying water-based serums and notice that the hydration lasts a lot longer. Also, this has the completely unexpected but amazing side effect of acting as a smoothing primer. When I apply tinted sunscreen, concealer, and powder afterwards they just glide on and cover evenly. It’s worth buying and using for that purpose alone! All of the products I’ve tried from this brand are amazing but this one is a surprisingly delightful, knock-it-out-of-the-ballpark good, new HG status, product.

I used this product along with the hyaluronic acid and the natural moisturizing factors per THE ORDINARY website which suggested this combo for dry skin. I tested everything and my skin appeared to tolerate it fine but within 4-5 days my whole face was more dry than before starting this routine, rashy/broke out, and just overall redness and irritation. I would not recommend this product to anyone with very sensitive skin. All of these products are very concentrated and that is great but if you have skin that doesn’t tolerate such strong effects then I don’t think these are the products for you.

It doesn’t completely disappear until after a few nights but it’s an amazing product that I highly recommend everyone to try. I will however say that it is drying even for me and I have oily skin, so make sure you moisturize especially if you already have dry skin. And make sure you’re still cleaning your face and washing it and doing your normal skincare. I also know that it works for certain skin types and some people don’t like it but please give it a go. It’s pretty inexpensive and does an amazing job. I live by this stuff and refuse to go back to drug store or even high end pimple spot patches.

I'm 34 with LONG history of cystic acne. my skin is oily t zone, central american skin with hereditary HUGE pores. been on antibiotics, accutane, and now on spironolactone. my skin is clear for the most part except for monthly pop ups. I started using this serum last year when I was on NO acne meds. Then it made me break out. I stopped using it , my skin cleared only a little and then I resumed using it. Then I broke out again and I stopped using it but my break outs didn't stop. I was put on spironolactone and now that I'm clear I have resumed using it. It does work, but maybe not for hormonal cystic acne ppl like me. This silky, non oily serum is quickly absorbed into your skin. you wake up with soft, plump skin and over time your acne scars and pores s apppear softer and faded. Your look and texture of skin seem more filtered. I recommend it only if you have your acne under control. Good luck.

I saw my pores and my dark spots literally disappeare within a week of use. My face looked Photoshoped without makeup. I couldn't believe it! Naturally I ran and bought the huge bottle of that miracle. But then the effect was getting less and less noticeable with time and I was starting to worry. When I finished the bottle it took me ten days to order and receive the new one. By that time all my dark spots were back. It was so weird and frustrating. Ok, it made sense that pores wouldn't stay tiny forever, but how does an old pimple disappear and then come back? HOW? With more use I realized this was doing nothing to address any skin concerns. It just somehow manages to mask the problem. Good old peels, moisture, exfoliation, retinol, acids etc really help but this quick fix is useless in the long run. I've kept it and I use it for a few days when I know a special occasion is coming up almost as part of my makeup. But no, I certainly don't rely on it to help my skin.

Of course I have to say that I didn't have major skin issues or sensitivity coming into it, but for me getting this in my routine has changed everything. Also worth noting that it seems best to apply right after cleansing (or your post-cleanse products), with your face still damp. Otherwise it will just sit on top and not absorb for a long time. I can't imagine that I'll ever stop using this or be tempted to try another vitamin C product, especially when it's this affordable.

That said, I’ve learned how to get it to where the grittiness is at a minimum & it doesn’t feel too heavy as others have previously noted. I watched some videos abut the different types of vit c offered by the ordinary. (The ones that are on this page and on other sites as well.) When I ordered this I also ordered the moisturizing factors. I use a small amount of that with this treatment. I mix it on the back of my hand and apply to my face. It lessens the sandpaper feeling & personally I feel it absorbs to my skin faster & more effectively. I’m blown away by the results I’ve seen in only a week. My acne scars are noticeably lighter and the redness on my cheeks that I’ve literally fought for years is disappearing. My skin is even, hydrated, smooth & I have not experienced any irritation or break outs. Hallelujah! I highly recommend trying this and mixing it with the moisturizer. It’s been a game changer for me.

This product works really well on softening these lines, it really does make a big difference. I haven't had any problems with it clogging my pores like some reviewers have. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because the product tends to separate very quickly/easily and you have to shake it really well to be able to use it. After a certain point shaking won't even help and you have to get a new one before you've used it all up. Because if this I only purchase small bottles and get as many samples as I can, though this still happens with even the small sample bottles!

I have very sensitive skin and the Ole Serum would break me out if I applied anywhere but my cheeks. I'm using this product to lighten up the red spots left from acne. In just 2 weeks of use, I'm very pleased with the product. The redness has gone down significantly and I have a nice ""glow"". Absolutely no reaction from my skin which is great. I love the ""primer-y"" texture. It works double duty when I apply it in the morning before my makeup.

This is just too heavy and doesn’t have enough slip to it when blending it across the skin. I much prefer a gel-cream consistency that my skin seems to drink up easily. I’m also not a fan of the strange odor my skin exudes the next day after using any skincare products with Vit C in them. I can pick it out after using them even if it’s not prominently labeled. I’d rather just keep taking oral Vit C tablets. The topical ones also seem to leave me with a yellow/orange tint to my skin. I personally have yet to find one that “brightens”. I’d say if you have super dry skin and like a heavy feeling product, you might like this.

Now there are so many that are significantly better than this one. I do NOT have sensitive skin at all but find this to irritate my skin and has a tingling sensation. The cream is also incredibly thick and difficult to spread and sort of has a bit of a slight grittiness? It also has a strong smell. I'm 32 so I use skincare as prevention and not wrinkle reducing at this point, so I can't speak to how effective it is at that. It was too late to return so I use it as a hand cream and neck cream and it does leave my skin feeling super soft the next day. I just don't find this enjoyable to use as a face cream.

Especially in Canada where Luna is no longer available, it's a kind of alternative on the less intense side. It's a great starter or gentle alternative. Unfortunately, it is way too gentle for me. I did notice some changes in skin softness but no real changes in lines or pores. And the changes in softness took months to actualize. I do like having a backup gentle retinol to use on days when a more concentrated one is too much for my skin and this is a good option.

I thought to myself, there is no way it was that good. I must have just had a good couple of months. So I didn't order more. Within a WEEK, ALL of the blemishes returned. I bit the bullet and bought some more UFO. 3 days into using it all the blackheads are gone and my acne is smaller and drying out yet again. This is 100 percent the best product I have ever used to fight my acne and blemishes all while keeping my skin even and hydrated. I use a caffeine cream for my eyes, then I use UFO on my face and chest (it even helps with the little red spots I have on my chest that is not acne... just little bursts of red) then I use my Tarte Drink of H20 to moisturize.

My skin is extremely acne prone so I found a website (skinsalvationsf) and had to get rid of all the products that were clogging my pores and causing breakouts (even products that claim to be non-comedogenic). So thankfully I wasn’t getting new acne at this point but my skin was still extremely congested with lots of blackheads, whiteheads, and texture. When I started using this I saw a difference the next day. The existing pimples I had were purging and healing faster and I could literally see the blackheads poking out. I also had less texture and hyperpigmentation. Overall my face looked clearer and I couldn’t stop starring at it in the mirror. I’ve only been using for one week but everyday I have less blackheads and texture. I’m truly amazed. I’m so glad that I finally got serious about getting rid of my acne. There are a lot of acid products on the market but with extremely acne prone skin like mine it’s hard to find something with truly non-comedogenic ingredients. My first choice was the salicylic acid of course but I believe it’s being reformulated is it’s out of stock at the moment. But mandelic is also good for acne because it’s antibacterial and antifungal. I’m new to acids but my skin is oily and not sensitive. I was able to use this every morning from the start while still using my prescription retin-a gel at night with no problems. I don’t know TO does is but at this price cannot be beat!!

However, unlike my teen years, my adult acne was worse—small bumps on my forehead + deep, painful pimples along my cheek, mouth, and jawline. For the next 2 yrs I tried everything...Tatcha, Philosophy, Sunday Riley, Youth to the People, Arbonne, R+F, Foreo luna, even hormonal medication....NOTHING was working. On a whim I tried this...and in one week, O.M.G. I use it every night after cleansing. I have an oily t-zone, so this is sufficient. But on my dryer cheeks, I pat Bio-oil on top for added moisture. I have not had a single pimple since using this. Forehead bumps = GONE. Not only do I feel better in my skin, my face physically does not hurt from painful pimples.

I have been a devout Drunk Elephant fanatic for about a year, so it was out of the ordinary for me to purchase TO products but there are so affordable I figured why not give it a shot. I have been using the mandelic acid for two and a half days and I literally have not had one Whitehead, blackhead, hormonal jawline acne, cystic zit or even a clogged pore! I'm so happy I could cry. Another great thing I have noticed is by the end of the day my face is not a big oil pit like usual. Lastly, all of the blemish spots, scabs and scars that I had on my face have healed quicker than they ever have before. I cannot wait to see my skin at the end of the week! Definitely will repurchase and I will be purchasing more of The Ordinary products.

I immediately fell in love with this and I ended up buying two bottles of this and so far my skin absolutely loves this. This kind of reminds me of the Estée Lauder serum but for 1/3 of the price. I’m hooked. My skin feels so moisturized and not oily or sticky whatsoever.

I had a cluster on my forehead near my hairline, and my lip was getting pretty freaking brown and moustache looking. I also suffered from a dark line on the back of my neck. All of these areas gave me anxiety, and I was skeptical of vanishing creams. I read the good reviews for the Murad serum, and bought the mini bottle, just in case it didn't work. I will be buying the big bottle after I finish the little one, which for my small areas, has lasted me quite awhile. It absolutely works, and I am shocked, amazed, and so incredibly happy with the results. If you're looking for a solution like I was, feel confident in taking a chance with Murad.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"1. This product is painfully expensive. I tried two samples (included in Murad kits, for about $30 with three products in it) before I actually purchased this. Do yourself a favor and buy a trial kit to give this product a shot. You might not see results before you use the tiny bottle (I didn't), so you can always purchase a second trial kit to give it another chance. You'll get a very good cleanser and moisturizer in each, which I use for travel! 2. Results are guaranteed! I grew up with a million freckles and I absolutely adored them. I only became concerned with hyperpigmentation around May of 2019 (five months ago) due to some dark marks where I had pretty serious hormonal breakouts. I had two large spots, one on the tip of my nose and one on my chin, which caused me to seek out some solutions for dark spots. 3. You MUST wear sunscreen with this product. My favorites are the Coola Sun Silk Drops for workdays, school, etc., but if you're going to be at the beach, use the Murad Environmental-C cleanser (it's safe and environmentally friendly)! Not only has this product completely erased my acne marks, but now my freckles have faded and my skin is luminous. Between this and my daily use of sunscreen now, my skin looks incredible.

This serum has made a significant difference in keeping them clean on a daily basis even with layers of skincare and makeup. A clean pore is a smaller looking pore. I apply this 2x/day after toner and essence, but before other serums, moisturizer and sunscreen. My Tips... 1). It potentially can be drying if you don’t use a moisturizer. 2). Sunscreen is a must when using this during the day. 3). The pump dispenses too much. You only need a half-pump to cover your entire t-zone. Therefore this bottle will last a very long time!!! 4) Before buying this listing, see if Sephora has it available as a gift set as that will save you money and/or score you additional products at the same price. Just search Caudalie in Sephora search bar to look for value gift sets.

I only uses it once a day and 30ml lasts for about a month. Second, I don't feel any effect other than the texture and smell is nice. For the most part, it is moisturizing. But for $115, I have so many other options. Third, the design of the bottle makes a lot of waste of the product (and your money)! The tube is too short to absorb the last 3ml on the bottom. Plus there is left over inside the tube and around the neck of the bottle; even 1/10 of the product is 10 bucks I am curious how other people deal with.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"First off, I have super sensitive medium-tone skin that is both oily and dry depending on the time of year and temperatures. In the fall and winter I get eczema on my face, mostly at my temples and jaw line. I will admit that with 70-80 percent of products I try, I end up breaking out on my skin...even from SPF or the type of oil included. For example, I cannot use foundation with SPF and I even break out if I use Moroccan Oil hair products. Keep this in mind because if you have eczema, especially on your face... I’m going to continue as to why this is 5 stars. I have tried almost all facial creams and have been prescribed antibiotics to clear my peeling skin for ten years each fall and I struggle to keep my makeup on for the full day because my skin gets so dry and flaky that I sometimes exfoliated multiple times a day just to prevent the embarrassing redness and dryness. I NEVER would have paid this much for a product/tried a product claiming (without explanation) to roll off dead skin without irritation given my reaction to most products. However, over Christmas I was staying at my place I rent out to a makeup artist in the Midwest and she told me to help myself to her products. Within 2 days of exfoliating with this product and applying a VERY thin layer of my eczema topical cream before moisturizing with Tatcha Water Cream (which I also tried for the first time because of my renter) and my skin had not been this beautifully and clear with any other combination. I have tried 8-9 different topical creams (both steroid and non-steroid) and honestly I cannot even express how shocked I was that this product with Tatcha Water Cream made my skin look flawless AND FELT SOOOOO good. The overall feeling of my skin when I move it after exfoliating and moisturizing is better than any SPA facial I’ve spent hundreds on; I encourage and recommend this product to anyone else who struggles with redness, skin sensitivity, dry skin and eczema as a face wash and solution.

I’ve noticed a difference in the way my skin looks since using it, and I really think it has decreased my fine lines. I typically get some Botox for fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes but I haven’t had it since October and my skin looks great. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I’d the price. It’s ridiculously expensive, But the quality is good for the price

I wanted to give them quite a few uses before reviewing. This serum is nothing special. It’s not terrible but does leave a kind of sticky residue on your face. For the price this is a 1 star.

I actually compared the ingredients to two other Hyaluronic serums and they were closely identical. Due to this, the price in my opinion, is not justified whatsoever.

In the past year, I've tried a number of serums from a variety of high end companies. The serum went on light and a little goes a very long way. It is non oily or drying and smells great. In combination with the entire face product line, it helps skin look healthy, toned and radiant. The serum really sealed in the moisture of the other products (face and eye cream), especially during cold winter months. I used it during the months of January and February. Theres very little, if any, makeup is needed for a natural look. My friend agreed. I am definitely a fan of this product line. I highly recommend.

I even think I had a nice color going on!

The sample was quite small so I thought that there wouldn't be enough to really produce any results from its use. I was so wrong! One to two drops is really all that is needed for your whole face, so the tiny sample lasted nearly a month. I started seeing noticeable results after the second use. Not only do I have Rosacea, but I also suffer from Lupus - the skin on my cheeks and nose are constantly red, inflamed and bumpy, (certainly not ideal for make up application). After the first use, my skin felt softer and moisturized. After the second use, there was a reduction in the redness. After using it once a day, for six days, not only was the redness gone, but the texture had improved significantly. After two weeks, my skin was absolutely unrecognizable. I received so many compliments from my friends and family on how beautiful my skin looked; I haven't received compliments like that in over a decade! I was able to leave my house without wearing any make-up! I immediately purchased the 1oz bottle and I swear this serum has been a lifesaver for me. I've used anti-redness cleansers, anti-inflammatory creams, gels, serums...medications from my dermatologist, make-up products to cover the problem areas (only to accentuate the horrible texture)... I've tried so many products that have only worked to mask my skin problems but this one actually fixed them. I highly recommend this to anyone who has similar skin issues; it is, sincerely, a miracle worker!

As for my dark spots, I don’t see a difference at all so I don’t believe it’s a one stop shop but still a nice improvement on the wrinkles and pores.

Skin Type Normal",3 stars,"While I am somewhat new to retinol/retinoids, I have researched them thoroughly, and was using a retinol prior to receiving this product for testing purposes, so I am reviewing with this in mind. Overall, I’d give this product a B-. It is packaged appropriately in a glass container (with dropper) which helps maintain the stability of the active ingredient. The serum applies smoothly, and seems to dry down shortly after, like that of a dry oil. The fragrance is a little odd—like the bitterness of walnuts or pecans—but not terribly off-putting. Ultimately, I think the product claims are too lofty: “delivers accelerated results within 24 hours” and “visibly improves...without redness, flaking, or dryness.” I’ve found that of the clinical evidence supporting retinol as an anti-aging ingredient, it makes clear that it must be used consistently over time before dramatic results can be seen. In addition, though I have sensitive skin, I’d been using retinol for about 6 months before trying this product, and built up a tolerance, as is recommended starting out—but still, I experienced some dryness and flaking around my laugh lines after just one use. All of this said, I do think it a quality product, but because it is clearly a very strong chemical exfoliant which should be used with care, I think the description and results claims should better reflect this. All in all, I see this product being great for seasoned retinol users without sensitive skin; others might enjoy it as well, if used carefully, but given the price, I’d recommend sampling it beforehand if possible.

It takes AT LEAST two days for this stuff to target and treat the acne, it’s not over night. You won’t visibly see results until days later. You’re better off using tea tree oil because it’s naturally derived and has better anti bacterial benefits. Although tea tree oil stings and is strong sometimes, this EradiKate treatment is just as painful if not worse. It stings just as bad and it’s just not as effective as people are making it out to be.

This lightweight cream tingles slightly upon application, but isn't enough to irritate my skin, and goes away quickly. I wake up in the morning with noticeably brighter and tighter skin, and I haven't had any new breakouts since I started incorporating this into my nighttime routine. This serum, in my honest opinion, is worth every penny. LOVE this!

So I gave about a month of using this product to write a review because I wanted it to be tried, true, put a stamp on it, whatever. I use it only for skincare, so I cannot attest to any benefits other than for topical use. But WOW! Let me preface by saying that I have very dry skin, but my work environment constantly has me flying on dry, moisture-lacking airplanes to all different climates for work. Because of this, my dry skin typically becomes oily by the end of the day, and even more so if I’m sent to humid places for work. On top of that, I have sensitive, acne prone skin. Despite being a self-professed skincare guru, I have never found a product that didn’t break me out/soak into my parched skin/cause redness/etc. THIS. IS. MY. HOLY. GRAIL. SKINCARE. PRODUCT. Never did I imagine i would come across an OIL of all products that would soak right up into my thirsty skin, dissipate the redness I occasionally get, clear my skin up, and completely change the texture of my skin!!! Seriously I am in shock at how baby smooth my face is now. Y’all, I don’t care that it costs an arm and a leg, and if any of y’all have similar skincare concerns, I am tellingggg youuuu! This stuff is legit. It doesn’t have an odor at all to me, like some comments have said. In fact, the Herbivore CBD oil and the Saint Jane oil have far more intense odors than this beauty, and both don’t sink into my skin at all like this does. It’s pricey, but a little goes a long way. Three drops (not droppers, but drops) in the morning and three drops at night. I will buy this stuff until the day I swear y’all.

I had just started looking into CBD products on the app, namely the Josie Maran one and Herbivore. Unfortunately both products are online only and I wasn’t willing to spend money on a product I’ve never tried. This Lord Jones royal oil was in my Sephora so I took home a sample. I dab my finger into the oil and tap it on top of my moisturizer. My skin has completely changed for the better. I had from red pimples that wouldn’t stop popping up, it was like playing whack-a-mole except the ones I was working on still weren’t going away. It’s been a couple weeks of using one dab of this product morning and night and my skin has cleared, and no new pimples have appeared. I’m blown away. The discoloration from the flattened pimples are fading fairly quickly as well, usually it takes a couple months to fade even with daily vitamin C. I’m in love with this product and when I only need 2 drops a day, it’s well worth the money.

It provides lasting moisture but is not sticky for my normal skin. I only bought it as a facial oil but it is also AMAZING at calming down my stomach. I’m taking a medicine that causes the worst nausea and three drops of this stops the vomiting feelings right away! I honestly thought CBD is probably just one of those fleeting trendy things but paint me hooked now!

Skin Type Combination",3 stars,"I’m still a skeptic on the whole CBD movement trend . I know many people who swear by it but as a healthcare professional the amount of actual CBD that they re getting let alone whether it even passes through the skin barrier to be affective is questionable . I have seen studies where it is affective below the tongues and in high doses like really high that you can’t buy otc used in babies to stop seizures but their bodies are so small that even possibly using this high dose on an adult might not be beneficial either way I bit the bullet again to try this 1000mg CBD as this is one of the highest I’ve seen . FYI the bottle is 1000mg and approximately 40 mg with one full dropper and only 20mg per 1/2 dropper. So this is still actually pretty low but I did buy the oil that it might be better absorbed . I also bought is as a massage oil to use over muscles . Not as an actual skincare booster . 1. I didn’t feel any benefits in inflammation reduction or pain relief . But it was worth a shot . That being said friends who suffer from fibromyalgia swear by lord jones CBD . 2.this definitely smells of cannabis/ skunk weed. It’s stinky . Maybe this would help with redness/ rosacea but I can’t imagine using it in the face esp as a beauty skincare routine because of the scent and that’s not even taking into the acct if you work in a conservative Professional environment... the smell alone is just so strong . I even brought it to my massage therapist to use to see if it would help with my therapeutic massage and deep tissue massage and he won’t use it because it’s too strong . 3. It does say it contains no THC if that is a determining factor to purchase or not I gave it 3 stars bc a majority of people I know that use CBD swear by lord jones but I personally didn’t find it helpful but I also don’t find other CBD products helpful either maybe CBD doesn’t work for me or the placebo effect just hasn’t kicked in yet ;)

I bought it and it did little for my facial redness and little to keep my face hydrated.

I expected the smell, but when I put some in my mouth at the back of my throat, the smell lasted all day even after brushing my teeth. So I smelled like a straight up stoner. The taste: The issue is the grape seed oil. If using this orally, you are going to taste the bitter bite of the grapeseed oil, and that bitterness will last in your mouth. It isn't the most pleasant thing. When used on my face, it absorbs lightning fast like my skin is parched for this. It is incredible. It has helped reduce my redness from eczma. When taken orally, it actually made a difference in my anxiety. When I felt overwhelmed and needed to pull out of it and focus and get things done, I took half a dropper full, and there was a substantial difference. I am so happy with this. It is a very versatile product.

I kid you not- I was staring at myself in the mirror in complete disbelief at how soft, smooth and glowy my skin became! I am super into healthy ingredients and the ingredients in this magical serum are so pure and organic and good for you. Please do yourself a favor and go out and get this serum for bright and glowing skin!

After a month of trying out the serum and oil, my skin feels smooth, dewy and refreshed. The smell of the vitamin C is amazing too! After trying out Kora’s vitamin c, I never want to go back to any other brand.

You end up with a nice healthy moisturized warm glow. I love slathering my face and neck in this serum on the weekends when I'm not really wearing much makeup. It also works great mixed with moisturizer or skin tint for a sheer, dewy glowy coverage look! I just don't love the pink plastic packaging! It seems to take away from the premium nature of the brand overall. But that is more of an aesthetics thing (I love to travel with serums and oils to keep my skin hydrated and healthy during work trips and such, so it is seen coming out of my purse, and I like to display certain skin care items on my bedside table and in my bathroom cabinet, so the look of the product def matter to me for aesthetics!) Also, the pump itself is not as smooth and effortless as it could be - hard to control getting just a tiny bit out... it'll be nothing and then all of a sudden a big pump of serum comes out.

It will hurt if you have open, active, acne cysts, just the same that rubbing alcohol will. It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee to cut the pad in half to extend the shelf life. I cut all 60 pads in half with sterile scissors after initially opening the jar. I also pour a few teaspoons of rubbing alcohol in the bottom of the jar after initially opening the jar, to prevent it from drying out. It takes time for this product to work. Using it twice a week and eventually every other day, will clear up a lot of acne, IF YOU STICK IT OUT AND USE A WHOLE JAR! Don’t expect results after 5 days. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Plus, using all 60 pads ensures that the acne “flare-up” isn’t due to natural bodily cycles. Good luck

I had been suffering from a minor breakout along my upper lip region so I bought these to try and correct the breakout while improving the rest of my face. Within two days, I had giant, cystic zits form on both cheeks (roughly 3-4 on both cheeks), three along my chin, and three along my forehead. Plus, two more emerged along my upper lip. It’s been nearly a month now and I’m still trying to combat the breakout that emerged after using these. While i’ve considered that my skin was purging, it shouldn’t have been that extreme.

I went to get a hydrafacial after using these for a few weeks, and the technician told me almost nothing came out of my skin. She told me my skin was like butter.

I do think this has helped with my rosacea breakouts - I have noticed less of this during my time using this product. But my skin is still pretty red and reactive, I had hoped it would have improved more than this over the month or so I've been using this. Also I find this bottle isn't lasting long at all. I purchased just over a month ago and I'm almost out (it could just be that I'm using more than I should, but then I'd expect the results to be better too). I use twice daily for reference. I think in combination with other products this might help more with redness but overall I wasn't super impressed.

A solid addition to any skincare routine.

I did some research online and after some extensive reading and trying to learn how to combine their serums and creams, etc., I bought a few of their products. But out of all of them, Matrixyl is the only product I started putting on my hands, usually just once a day, before I moisturize in the evenings. It only took about a week before I started noticing a big difference. I'm in the sun a lot and I'm rough on my hands - the fine lines and damage have dramatically diminished. I was shocked at the difference and now I'm a big fan! Even the texture of my skin is smoother. I would highly recommend anything from their line - I have a different ritual in the AM and PM, which combines about 6 of their different products and I've seen benefits with every single one.

A few years back the oil smelt very fresh and citrusy and the colour used to be more yellowish with the tiny gold particles. However, now it smells like really bad oil that’s gone bad and it became a clear oil with gold particles that wouldn’t stick to add a glow to your face. I recently went to a Sephora and the store manager opened another new bottle for me and it still smelt like it had gone past it’s expiry. I don’t know what they changed in it’s formula but I wouldn’t recommend it AT ALL! After making the biggest mistake of applying on to my face, my face started breaking out everywhere! Trust me and do not buy this product! I’m surprised Sephora hasn’t pulled it off it’s shelves.

I really wanted to love it, and really tried to at least use it up but honestly it smelled like fish oil and since it wasn't making any difference to my skin I just couldn't deal with that smell. The fishy smell persisted on my skin for several hours after applying -- even after makeup on top -- so I had to toss this. I have other face oils that work well and don't smell so I couldn't see a good reason to keep it. I can't understand what amazing benefits could possibly be in this to make it worth putting up with that smell when there are other excellent oil products out there that smell neutral or even nice.

I had finally convinced my best friend to purchase this product, and right she had returned for the simple fact that it doesn't have smell right. Smell's like the oil went bad.

Skin Type Combination",1 star,"***First Time Every Returning a Sephora Product*** I've tried a lot of pricey skin serums and oils, and I'm here to tell you this stuff is either a gimmicky joke, or this brand has some serious quality-control breeches in their production pipeline, with bad-batches still lining the shelves of Sephora as of late December 2019. As a skincare aficionado, I was excited to try this stuff, especially because the price point seemed pretty low for a product allegedly containing a bunch of top-notch ingredients, including gold. Joke's on me... The moment I opened the bottle I knew something was wrong. It smelled like old, rancid canola oil that's sat lidless in the back of your cabinet for 4 months. I appreciate and use mostly fragrance-free products; I'm a huge fan of some of Biologique Recherche's stinky-but-effective serums. Consequently, I think I can tell the difference between smelling odd in a rancid way, versus smelling odd in simply a ""natural ingredient"" way. This stuff falls decidedly in the former category. Despite my smell-based instinct that something was off, I made the mistake of applying a small amount to my face. Unlike other high-quality oils, this did not seep into my skin to leave behind fresh, non-oily, dewy moisture. It seemed to stagnate on the surface of my skin, leaving behind an un-breathing, oily veneer. It felt so uncomfortable that I washed it off less than an hour later. In hindsight, this is probably why I only mildly broke out a day later, as opposed to the massive breaking out that some of the other reviewers experienced. I'm one of those consumers who gets that the performance of personal care products can be nuanced given skin-type and environmental factors, so my default isn't to immediately assume I've been scammed and leave a punitive review. However, this product was bad enough that I felt a moral obligation to return it in hopes that it might compel Sephora to flag any bad-batch or fraudulent marketing issues

I suffered from a terrible breakout during my second semester and while my skin is clear now I have lots of red marks leftover from the acne. Azelaic acid is considered safe to use during pregnancy, so I have been religiously applying this every night to my red marks. While they aren’t gone, I definitely see an improvement. I think with this product consistency is key, and it’s not an overnight miracle worker. It does work, but it will take time. I only use this product at night because it does have a sort of sticky/tacky texture that I don’t think would wear well under makeup. If you’re looking for immediate results, this product probably isn’t for you. But if you want something that is not irritating and more of a gradual improvement, I definitely recommend this. Love the ingredients! I was sent this serum for free, in exchange for an honest review. I struggle with hormonal acne and I really wanted to try this for its ingredients. Azelaic acid is an ingredient I trust, it has worked for me in the past so I was curious to put this to test. I saw minimal difference in the two weeks that I've been testing it, so these are my first impressions and I would like to believe that I will see a major difference with long term use. I would love to see the packaging changed, this would work better as a pump than a dropper. Overall, fab ingredients give it a try if it fits your budget.

I would’ve preferred a pump, it would have been better to have more control over dispensing the product. I always get more product than I want, especially since this is a spot treatment serum and not meant to be used all over the face. The serum itself can be considerably sticky on the skin after application, which goes away if you use a moisturizer. And, it just isn’t working fast enough for me.

A small background about my skin: I’m 26 and I have severe acne scarring on my cheeks area. This drops is mighty and with consistency you can definitely see the difference. My acne scarring redness have definitely decreased. It did not go well under my make up so i refrain from using it in the morning now and only use it at night before going to sleep. It does have a bit of a tacky texture but I’m assuming it’s ok since the effect is there. One drop goes a long way and i only put some on my scarring area and not the entire face. I don’t have any sun spots so I cannot test for that but it have definitely help with redness from acne scarring.

I make sure to apply this only on those targeted areas. The light weight, non sticky texture of the product makes it very easy to layer underneath other hydrating and moisturizing products without piling. The ingredient combination is just perfect! My skin appears bright and even toned. The spots are taking their own time to fade. I can amp up the use to every night to see quicker results but I avoid that because I prefer slow results anyday to an over sensitive skin. I have yet to see any redness, burning or peeling and I appreciate that. It is a good product! I love that this comes in an opaque bottle with a simple dropper for easy dispensing.

For reference I have semi-mature (I’m 35yrs old) combination skin with a few minor dark (sun) spots I was wanting to fade. I applied this serum as a spot treatment for my dark areas only. After I cleansed my face, I applied this serum every morning and night for a week. It’s very lightweight feeling and quick absorbing. It didn’t feel sticky either. One week isn’t long enough to see major results so my expectations were low..to my surprise I noticed my dark spots were def fading a little!! I can’t wait to see the results after using it for longer period of time. Oh, don’t forget to wear sunscreen if you apply this concentrated treatment in the morning cause your skin might be sensitive to the sun! Anyways, I highly recommend you try this serum! It looks so chic on my vanity with its cute, slick packaging :)

I have always liked using an acne/ oil control face wash in the AM but my current one contained salicylic acid which is not safe to use during pregnancy. I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product. Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used! I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my t-zone while not over drying the rest of my face. I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily t-zone but normal-dry cheeks. I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer. It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient? The smell doesn’t linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face. I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away. This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again, it is just so good!

While searching, I came across this product and based on the reviews, I took a chance and decided to buy the full size. I was wowed by the initial result at how bright my skin was.I didn't realise how amazing this product was until recently however. My skin began to freakout about 2 months ago, as result of facial threading. Nothing was helping and the breakouts were getting worse. Initially, I stayed away from this product, because I thought anything that exfoliates would be too harsh for my sensitive skin given the breakouts, turns out I was wrong! I started using the powder again, because I traveled and it was the only wash I had at the time. I used it consistently for 4 days and to my pleasant surprise, the breakouts started to subside. Almost 7 days later and the breakouts have almost completely disappeared! All I can say is WOW!!! This stuff is amazing! I am so grateful I had it in my arsenal of skincare when I needed it! I'll definitely be repurchasing and also now using as my daily cleanser.

It is easy to use and gentle on the skin but yet still so effective. This has helped keep my skin radiant and glowing and helped to remove dark spots from acne. Note that it looks very similar to the tatcha powder cleanser but works very differently. This works more like a chemical exfoliator rather than a physical one and is much more effective in my opinion. I use a little less than the packaging automatically dispenses. Great product. Don't sleep on it!

Love that it leaves my normal/dry skin feeling super soft and it’s not too harsh on my sensitive skin for using it twice daily. Docked a star for the fact that the bottle went from 70 to 50 grams for the same price. Overall bottle design seems better, though. I found the previous design allowed for clumps to form and get lodged in. I ended up prying it open one day (after trying for at least half an hour) to get the rest of the product out due to the clumps that formed blocking the opening.

This product does contain fragrance which I'm usually sensitive with but I find that once the powder is mixed with water it is not noticeable and it does not linger on the skin once washed off. I also find that after just using it once my skin looks so much brighter and it has decreased the size of my pores. My acne scars have slowly been disappearing with the use of this product in the last 2 months. I have also received so many compliments on how my skin looks so much nicer lately. This product is expensive but it lasts as I still have more than half a bottle and I have been using this product at least once a day the past 2 months. This product is definitely going to be a staple in my skin routine from now on.

I have a great skin care regime now so I don't get acne as often as I used to however whenever I can feel one coming, I put this on it and it really aids in helping it go away quickly. A little goes a long way so, for me, the small bottle lasts a long time. I accidentally purchased the large one this last time and I notice the opening where the product comes out is also larger and lets out more product than I need. So, regardless of how often you use it, I'd recommend the smaller bottle. Plus you can more easily stash the smaller one in your purse. I wish I had discovered this product when I was a teenager!

After trying many products that claim to reduce whiteheads but didn't work on me, I went in to a store and asked a Sephora employee for any recommendations. The first thing he recommended was this mask. Then, he also asked another associate if there's anything she would recommend. The first thing she mentioned was also this mask. So, naturally I just had to give it a try. And, I'm glad I did! I could see results just after one or two tries! I'll definitely repurchase.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I have been using this product for well over three years, and by far it is one of my favourite face masks I have ever used. I use this after using the Umbrian clay facial scrub and they are phenomenal together. The reason I really like this particular face mask is because not only does it make my skin feel softer and definitely refreshed but every time I use it I can visibly see the results of my skin looking better. It looks smoother, brighter and almost as though my skin has been airbrushed. I have tried a couple of other pore purifying masks - both drugstore brands but also other brands that Sephora carries - and yes a lot of them also make my skin feel very similar BUT the visible appearance of my skin following is nothing compared to using this mask. It is definitely worth a purchase and even though it is a bit pricey it might be best to try out the smaller size to see how it work for each individual. I have tried those mask on a few of my friends that have problem skin because they have enlarged pores and get acne breakouts and they have had phenomenal results as well. I think it is definitely worth the purchase if you’re overwhelmed with multiple options. It also had a light and refreshing natural scent, when I use it, it reminds me of having a great facial at a spa.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"I wanted to wait at least 2 weeks to leave a review... I'm a huge skincare junkie and I read about the benefits of alpha arbutin (lightens dark spots) and wanted to try it. This product is a lifesaver. I suffer from stubborn hyperpigmentation from picking my face and it's significantly lightened them and overall brightened my face. I use this in combination with their azelaic acid suspension (also treats hyperpigmentation/breaks down keratin - the cause of whiteheads and milia) and the results have been incredible. Yes, it is a lot more oily and thicker than your typical vitamin C serum. It doesn't necessarily ""sit"" on my face like other reviewers, but I do understand what they mean. I think because I blend it with their suspension (a creamy texture) and a HA serum it helps with that and the end result just feels so smooth (I wait less than a minute in between products). Try mixing it with that or your favorite lightweight moisturizer to ease up the texture. No, I do not recommend it to those who have very oily skin and/or plan to wear this under heavy makeup. I don't wear face makeup on a daily basis so I ""seal"" it with my tinted sunscreen and it leaves me with a smooth, soft finish. I also don't recommend it to those who have never used a vitamin c serum before. Ascorbic acid is the strongest form of vitamin c so it could cause irritation/breakouts if your skin is not used to it. It tingled just a bit the first week I started using it. That being said I also don't recommend mixing it with a strong AHA/BHA. I recommend this to those who suffer from hyperpigmentation from acne (not pitted acne scars), sunspots, normal/dry/combo skin, for those looking to switch their vitamin c serum, and to those who just want to overall brighten their complexion without breaking the bank (I see you, Skinceuticals).

The company discloses the percentage of arbutin. 2. The price is very affordable. CONCLUSION: It might be good for slightly lightening your overall skin tone, but not powerful enough to lighten already-darkened brown spots in a short time (1-2 months). It might be going to lighted brown spots if I continue using this product for a long time, sat for more than 6 months, but I really don’t like the texture of this product and don’t feel like continuing using it till I start seeing the result. Overall I love The Ordinary products, but not this one.

It doesn't cause any redness or peeling, only an annoying itchiness around my cheeks and jawline. I gave it a fair try, and really wanted it to work. But I noticed no benefits, and will officially discontinue use since the mild discomfort doesn't seem to be worth it. One good thing about this is that a little bit goes a long way, but it does make my face feel really greasy.

Vitamin C in high doses helps with redness from sun damage and can possibly help with brown discoloration though hydroquinone works much better. At this strength you would want to use it more for spot treatment or to mix just a drop with moisturizer, no more. It’s just too strong and can cause a breakdown of skin integrity causing acne in those prone to it (read the research not the advertising or the reviews based on advertising). Vitamin C is oxidizing and this isn’t always good for skin. If I had paid better attention to the strength of this product I would have skipped it.

The first couple of weeks, the oil smelled like kale and black cumin oil. (Note: Black cumin oil can smell like pencil shavings when rancid btw). After a month, there is now a thin white film on one side of the bottom of the bottle; I hope it is not contaminated or rancid. Screw that lid on tight, ladies!

I have oily, acne prone skin, most of my breakouts are hormonal, with very large pores. You WILL NOT see immediate results. As a matter of fact, 2 weeks in, I started purging and breaking out pretty bad. I know retinol is not an ingredient used for the short term...so I just kept using the serum. I am SO GLAD I did! Things have cleared up. I wake up with smooth, even skin, I am not nearly as oily during the day, plus, bonus, my forehead wrinkles are no longer noticeable! I purchase the 2 oz bottle because it just makes sense when used day and night. I urge you to try this product for a minimum of two months, then assess your progress.

I am 27, acne prone, combination with sensitive light skin that seems to be getting more sensitive with age. I enjoyed the formula and did see results with brightening and smoothing of my forehead lines. I also used the extra-strength acid peels from dr. Gross(beautiful formula) and I bought the big $88 box. Together they work beautifully. This is an investment! It’s either this or I cheap out and use the ordinary Granactive retinoid serum. The difference of quality is obvious, the ordinary works but the formula isn’t as luxurious meaning it usually is more harsh and drying. Also since I have combination skin I needed something that worked well in both areas of my face. I’ve had recent bad hormonal breakouts so I needed to switch to something heavy duty and I’m on curology with a retinoid in my formula and it’s been tricky to keep motivated to keep with it because of how strong the formula seems to be. Once I feel my acne has calmed down I will probably switch back to the duo I was using. It’s just easier because you don’t go through that weird dry flaky phase(3rd month of it) and you can continue to incorporate other products without your skin freaking out (retinol wise).

This serum is incredibly gentle and enjoyable to use, making it a luxurious (self care) addition to your skincare routine. However, if you are truly looking to fight hyper-pigmentation/texture concerns or even out and brighten your skin tone, I would recommend a different serum with more potent active ingredients. Pitera and niacinamide are the first few ingredients listed for this product, which is reassuring -- I do not doubt that over years and years of consistent use, your skin will very slowly and subtly transform with this serum. However, I personally do not have that patience (or wallet capacity), especially when there are significantly more potent and effective niacinamide products out there at a tiny fraction of this price.

Imagine Edward Cullen's face in Twilight when he's in the direct sunlight - putting this on your face is kind of a toned down version of that look because basically you're spreading teeny tiny light reflecting pieces of glitter on your face. I'm pretty sure most of the magic of this product is in the way the light reflects off these tiny specks of glitter and makes your face shine/radiate. So far, one week in, I haven't seen any skin deep results where it's cleared out any old sunspots or dark areas, it feels like it's mostly a party trick with the glitter in the serum. If you have oily skin this might make your skin look a bit shinier because of the glitter in the serum. I will continue to use because I think if I use it minimally it can work well as a highlighter. The dropper applicator is also kind of weird because it's just not the easiest thing to use and I'm concerned that I'm gonna be wasting a lot of product when I get to the end of it.

I was confused and thought this was an essence, but it is definitely a serum. For all the k-beauty addicts, I definitely suggest using a snail cream with it. :)

It goes on smoothly and a small amount of product can cover the entire face, neck and décolletage. I did like the way my face looked when I put on the serum but I honestly didn’t think it did anything to my skin; it’s just that it has an iridescence to it and whatever shimmery particles are in it, they make the skin look like it’s glowing. I can glow by mixing a little bit of shimmer cream or drops into my sunscreen and I don’t have to spend a ridiculous amount on a serum. It’s a good product but I’ve tried amazing ones for less 80 dollars or less. This one is not amazing, it’s just overpriced because of the brand name. No, thank you!

Received free product",4 stars,"I got the free product as part of a campaign for BzzAgent. I have been using it for the last 6 weeks. The pros are that the dropper makes it easy to dispense the product. There is no waste and an adequate amount is dispersed. I have noticed that my face feels brighter, and I have no new pigmentation although the old brown spots are still there. I have been complimented by my friends and am always asked if I have had a brightening facial. The product is easily absorbed and does not feel heavy or oily. There has been no breakouts and the product is incredibly light and is absorbed without problems. The fragrance is pleasing and not heavy or overwhelming. I will continue to use it after I run out of my free product, hoping that my old brown spots will be lighter. I think this product will be good for any type of skin and is good for preventing formation of new brown and pigmented spots.

I'm on my second bottle and I've been using this product for years... Just to give you an idea of how far it goes. I cleanse and put this on immediately after. Once it dries, then I'll go in with the rest of my skin regiment. Personally, it works better for whiteheads than blackheads or clogged pores/textured skin.

In the short time I’ve used this product I have received compliments, stares, and several questions about what products I’m using on my face. I went into Sephora asking for primer suggestions — something that will give me a dewy look/feel. I was expecting to purchase the Milk Hydro Grip Primer, but I’m always looking to try something new — & Farsáli has not disappointed me in the past. With this on, I’ve been called a porcelain doll from strangers and coworkers. A compliment I’ll take any day. (& it’s such a good feeling when you agree with the compliment yourself!) I do struggle with occasional acne and some red spots, so I was curious to see how well my makeup would stay on throughout the day to cover those blemishes. I use Born This Way Concealer and Peach Perfect Foundation, all by Too Faced, which already do a solid job of covering up my imperfections. But this... this here makes a big difference. From the moment I leave from work, to the last moments of the day before I take my makeup off — my face looks flawless.

When I woke up in the morning my skin looked brighter and the scar was noticeably smaller in just one night! Continued to use it for a week and the scar is practically gone. My fine lines on forehead have been minimized too. My teenage daughter tried it for her acne scars and it worked quick for her too. I’m paying the hefty price bc it’s worth it. Also, I don’t know where this supposed “smell” is that people are talking about , but my product did not smell bad. It smelled like vanilla, kind of like cupcake frosting mixed with a citrusy smell.

I mixed with my primer before I put on foundation, and I like how it doesn’t make my skin oily or cause my foundation to change it’s texture. However, I don’t know that it actually brightens my skin or anything like that. Also, it’s very expensive for me to not see a pretty big difference. I’ve been using Dr. Sturm products exclusively for 3 weeks that I received in return for my honest and non-biased review.

I would say it's just average in that it provided no more or less hydration or skin benefits than a drugstore serum like Olay. In that sense I consider this rather expensive for a small amount of product compared to drugstore brands where coupons make purchasing Olay / Aveeno/ or Garnier a better buy. One plus about this serum is that gel absorbs fast and is easy to layer moisturizer on top. I combined the serum with a drop of Revitalift hyaluronic acid for boost of moisture and softness.

I've always used moisturizing creams (including some recommended to me by a dermatologist nurse), but I would still be dry and peeling a bit while my chin became overly oily. The sephora rep put this on my skin during a Perk mini-facial and it's been amazing. No peeling and I don't feel oily at all. I put it on after washing my face and then either put normal SPF moisturizer on top (morning) or my overnight cream (night). My skin has been amazing. As noted, the bottle lasts about a month, which does make it a bit pricier than your normal OTC moisturizer, but I'm happy paying for amazing, hydrated skin. Recommended to my best friend and she had similar results. We both don't spend a lot of makeup or face products, but this is worth EVERY PENNY. Recently ran out on a trip (because my sister loves it and kept stealing it) and after just a week of not using it, I'm dried out and peeling. Just got back to town today and running FAST to Sephora to get more. Moral of the story - always have an extra on hand.

When I use products, I usually have to use them religiously so that I get the full effect-with a lot of creams, and serums leaving my skin absolutely dull and not helping at all, but this product is a God-send. It locks in moisture and repairs my skin, just like it says it will. I usually use the toner first, then this, then my moisturizer. All first aid beauty because it's the first brand that actually keeps my skin from drying out, especially during the winter months. I love, love, love this product. I recommend it. Sometimes though, it can leave a tackiness to my skin that'll usually go away once I put my moisturizer over it. I think the tackiness primarily comes from when I put too much product in one place so my skin doesn't absorb it all. You don't really need the full pump unless you have a giant face–which I don't, I just half-awake put it onto my face and remember afterwards that I put WAY too much onto my face.

I have noticed a slightly brighter complexion and smoother looking texture in the morning after nightly application. Best results will probably be noticeable after several weeks and I am anxious to see how my skin improves. The bottle is gorgeous and the pump works seamlessly. The actual cream texture of the serum was a bit surprising as I am used to a slightly thinner consistency when dealing with serums, but if you follow the directions and pat the product on instead of rub it works well. The smell is not too strong but not something particularly pleasant either. I tend to be quite sensitive and this did not cause redness or irritation at all. It may feel a little tingly at first, but quickly subsided. Overall, it is very nice for a resurfacing serum. I received this product free for testing purposes, all opinions are genuine and honest.

I received a complementary sample from Influenster to try, and I was a little dubious, but my skin feels smoother, tighter, and softer after just a few days. Additionally, there’s no tingling or stinging after application, which is great because I have VERY sensitive skin. I am looking forward to completing a full month with the product to see if the results on my pores are as good as others users have indicated! Typically I follow the application of this serum with their Noni Glow Face Oil, but I think I might actually see if they have other products I’m interested in as well, such as a moisturizer. I’m loving the brand because it’s clean and kind to animals – I’m trying to switch my entire beauty routine over to cruelty-free products, so I‘m always happy to find companies with animal friendly product lines!

And the answer is YES! First this is a certified organic night treatment serum using natural AHA and BHA to help re-surface the skin. It is a clean product that uses lemon peel, willow bark and grapes to exfoliate the skin minimize imperfections and make it softer. Let me tell you it did all that! It is non-greasy, has a light scent and does not irritate my sensitive skin. When I really noticed the serum worked was in the morning when I washed my face. My pores on my nose looked incredibly smaller and my face was so soft to the touch. This is the first time I’ve ever used anything from this brand and would definitely try more of their line in the future.

I have lines between my eyes and under them but otherwise no other deep lines. My concerns now that my acne cleared up are dullness and fine lines. I read every review on this, and waited for the winter sale from Sephora to splurge on it. The consistency is a thin oily serum that goes on so smooth and absorbs pretty quick. It smells like licorice but the smell fades fast. It’s gentle enough that I even use it on my under eyes! Results: I did not have any peeling, and this was my first retinoid product, but like I said my skin is pretty tough. I’m now using it every night and while at first I had some pretty intense daytime redness, I am seeing a marked improvement on the brightness and smoothness of my skin! I see a slight decrease in the lines by my eyes, and will continue to use this to prevent new ones from forming! A half-dropper full covers my whole face.

I think one of the most unique aspects of this product is that it's formulation allows for THE MOST SMOOTH application. With that being said, although this product costs an arm and a leg, I find that I really don't use that much product each time I use it because it spreads so well. That's obviously in addition to the fact that all the main actives in the serum are not irritating in any way, all while maintaining the promised efficacy. Will repurchase over and over again.

To say I am beyond pleased is putting it mildly. Hormonal acne and below the skin bumps in my temples (which Luna didn’t do much for) began to shrink after the first use. It is stronger, so even my retinoid-experienced skin did show some redness and sensitivity. This has been easily remedied by using the serum every other night and using a good moisturizer with SPF(!!!) during the day. If you’re new to retinoid/retinol products, it is normal to expect some level of “purging” as your skin begins to turn over and rid itself of the stuff you couldn’t see (but has definitely been there). And PLEASE remember that all retinoid/retinol containing products make your skin even more sensitive to the sun, so use some kind of SPF when you’re out about - even on cloudy days!

I wanted to give the products adequate time for a proper trial and review particularly because my skin was unpleasantly reactive to the retinoid serum the first week. I ususlly love PTR products, and so does my skin so I santed to be fair. After a week I discontinued and my skin needed 2 weeks to recover. A 2x week application after that caused another breakout. Ive given my skin another week without it to heal, and will update on this 1 use later. This will either be a weekly use product for me, or simply something I cant tolerate. Oddly, given I usually take retinol well.

My pores look smaller and this doesn’t make my face greasy (I have an oily t-zone) or clog my pores. However, I wouldn’t repurchase this product because of the price tag and because I see no firming effects at all. There are other serums I love that are even more hydrating.

This provides deep hydration without oiliness and has calmed down my easily irritated skin. It goes on smoothly, isn't sticky, and smells good. The price tag has been worth it for me. In the winter, I use this as my first layer as well, but also put a moisturizer before sunscreen because I need a little more hydration. Regardless of the season, this is a daily staple for me. I tend to get hormonal acne and don't react well to hidden acids or other ingredients. This has none of that. It's super clean and manages to baby your skin while still being effective.

I don't have many wrinkles but with age my skin started to look dull and my laugh lines were more noticeable, I noticed after 2 weeks of using this along with my usual moisturizer and make up that my face looks brighter and almost tighter. almost like when you lose weight and your face gets narrower but it really is just my skin looking better. I notice that my laugh lines are less noticeable because the skin around just looks tighter and smoother. Will continue to use this!

Drugstore is my go to, I have only purchase from Sephora with my own money if it’s like liquid gold! I’m also notorious for not finishing products as I guess I never found things that actually work for my skin. I am a new mom of a 3 month old boy (so I got that tired looking mom skin) but even before I was a mom I suffered from dull looking skin with a touch of redness on my cheeks and uneven skin tone at my jaw and under my eyes. I bought this 1.5-2 years ago with a gift card I received for my birthday or something after doing A LOT of research (I bought the 3 pack actually) and used it all until it was empty, loved the way my skin looked! I have since then repurchased the 3 pack a couple more times (dying inside every time as it’s $100-but thankfully it lasts a couple months at a time) this time I bought strictly this night time treatment and let me tell you this is the star of that whole set!! I notice a difference the first morning after I used it! My skin looks brighter and happier and evened out!!! I find I break out A LOT less and it’s just an overall amazing product! I apply this every night and if I remember correctly the bottle lasts a couple months. It can pill, but I find it doesn’t if you let it dry before applying moisturizer. I’m not a huge makeup wearer, and when I do i prefer sheer and glowy products, so this helps my skin look the best it can so my sheer products look flawless! I cannot recommend this product enough!!!!

The foam cleanser is amazing. It’s mild and does not dry out my skin. It has 2% Salicylic acid which is a must for fighting acne. The acne solution is very drying so need to moisturize before or after. I don’t hate it but I dont like it either. It did not make my skin any better nor made it worse per se. The moisturizer idk what it is but it actually made me break out on my forehead. Once I stopped using the moisturizer, the breakout died down.

(Mario B.) however, this is the best kit I've ever had, the first week I could see it was purging my skin, and by the second week it was basically clear except for hormonal acne. The gel is strong (and makes my eyes burn a bit), but it really does clear everything out. I've been a fan of cliniques moisturizer for years now, and I can feel it soaking up the oils.The only thing I could take or leave is the cleaner, but it was incredibly gentle on the skin. I wish it helped strip away makeup however (Like Philosophys cleanser does) Overall i loved it, and I'm probably going to buy the full size of each product. I will say, like some reviews say, you do need to use it twice a day, and if you're going to buy the full size product, get the gel moisturizer not the hydrating jelly.

I know all skin is different, but this product seemed to make my skin a lot worse, with an insane increase in blemishes and painful pimples, before working at all. And when the kit started to work, it only seemed like it was keeping those blemishes at bay, and not really healing them or clearing my skin. I gave this kit a month, and I didn’t notice any real improvements. I know that might not be long enough, but it was just too discouraging and I couldn’t continue to use this product. That being said, there are a lot of pros to this kit. First, the cleanser feels really nice on the skin, and so does the gel. Neither of these products dried my skin out, which was great! I even used both products in the AM and PM each day, and still no dryness. My skin felt like it was cleaner, but the redness from the blemishes was still there, and the bigger cysts didn’t seem to decrease in size really. Also, the moisturizer is awesome! I actually bought the full size of it because it works so well! It says it’s for oily skin, but my skin is more combo/dry, and it still works wonders. I would’ve paid this price just for that tiny moisturizer! Overall, I’m glad I tried this kit, and I think it’s worth a shot if you’re struggling with acne. However, if you have bigger cysts and more hormonal type acne like me, don’t go into this product expecting it to fix anything. It did make my skin feel cleaner, softer, less oily, and overall healthy, which I liked, but it didn’t do enough to clear up the acne.

This kit really helped me feel like I was able to obtain a clean face with the foam wash (I used a small scrubbing pad to exfoliate extra) and then pat a little bit of the clearing gel afterwards. The gel can feel very drying so a bit goes a looong way. However, the moisturizer is by far one of the best, if not THE BEST moisturizer have used in my skin. My skin tends to feel dry but gets super oily as the day goes by. Perhaps I touch my face a lot throughout the day unconsciously but a get shine and oily skin and t zone.

One use was enough to break me out really badly. I know this product is what caused it because I had not changed anything else about my routine in months. Instead of just dunking on this product and leaving it at that, I want to break down why it broke me out and why this formula isn't very good. First of all, it is formulated with SEVEN different fragrances. My skin can maybe occasionally handle a little bit of fragrance, but using more fragrances in your routine does increase the chances for irritation. Additionally, this product contains retinyl palmitate, an inactive form of vitamin A that isn't particularly safe for regular use, nor is it at all necessary to include in a sunscreen. It's entirely possible that the inclusion of this ingredient also contributed to my skin reacting poorly. I don't like giving bad reviews, but people deserve to know what is in their products and why they are potentially having a negative reaction to them. There are plenty of other clear sunscreens on the market that have much cleaner formulas (Supergoop comes to mind, as does Coola and Volition - by the way, I am not sponsored by any of these brands). I recommend purchasing one of those products, or one of many many others out there, instead.

It goes on super smooth and a little goes a long way. It lasts for a looooong time; I still reapply mid-day, but I can tell it's still on from the morning. I know the price seems a little high, but one bottle lasts me 6-7, and sometimes 8 months. I don't skimp when it comes to sunscreen, so this is a huge money-saver for me. I saw a few others that said this wasn't going on smooth- that happens at the start of every bottle but only for the first several uses. I just use a little extra and keep smoothing until it blends. Also, I've found that some cleansers can cause this to ""ball up"" as well. I ditched those cleansers and haven't had a problem since. The icing on the cake.... this makes your pores just disappear and really helps to make your skin tone look lovely. I've been able to cut back on makeup and just use this- compliments all the time!

I used to pick at my blemishes when they popped up, and I’d pick and pick until I dreaded going out in public. Acidic spot treatments worked fine to wean me from my habit but this thing has become my safeguard. I can’t live without it now. Although the pimples do not just disappear after use, they never get worse. If I can manage to leave the spot alone and just use this several times a day on it, it’s often gone within a couple days. Consistency is truly key; don’t give up if you don’t see results. Just keep applying until you learn how often you need to use it to get those suckers down. It’s not a great solution for all-over acne as it’s rather time consuming for big breakouts. And it’s not very effective on pesky blackheads. But it does often reduce the appearance of my pores. I’ve tried the cheaper ones sold at the drugstores and this one is better by light years. The surface area is much larger, the skin-sensor feature helps guide my hand when I’m not by a mirror, and the vibration is therapeutic, if nothing else. Read the studies about the science behind this. It’s no gimmick; blue light therapy works.

For months or years my skin may clear up, then out of the blue breakout for months and I have to do everything i can think of to clear it up. I’ve been on medications which just made it worse in the long term. I think I can probably pinpoint my cystic acne clearing up this time to right when I got this pen. It was bad for about 2 months, i would basically get a new pimple every few days along my chin and jawline. I started using this pen day and night going over each pimple multiple times. I saw results in a day! Pimples were much smaller. In a few days lots of them had cleared and new pimples were not forming! I do have an immaculate skin care routine as well (wash with Clarisonic, tea tree oil toner, chemical daily exfoliate, prescription benzaclin day and night, recently just included a retinoid at night), I think you need one with this pen to ensure you are not getting new breakouts. This pen doesn’t completely stop new breakouts, but it definitely severely reduces their size and time to heal. Once your cystic acne is somewhat cleared, I feel like it stopped new ones in the same spots from coming right away, but I still get a few here and there especially around my time of month. One downfall is that if you have multiple breakouts it does take a long time. Whenever I have a new cystic breakout I go over it 3- up to 10 times a session. It takes time but it’s worth it!!! For anyone not seeing results, try to use this more, I swear it works!!

The only cons are the charge and the coverage area. Depending on how many spots you have to cover, you might be charging this weekly if not more, and since the coverage area is so pinpointed, you'll have to add in the additional time into your beauty routine.

Before you buy it, google the studies in blue light and the types of acne to figure out if it will help. I get 4 types of acne on my face, it helps reduce 2 of them, which is great. Also, experiment on yourself by only using on half of your face for a month. My right side is always worse, so I tried it on that one and it definitely helped some of the acne clear in a few days which usually takes a couple of weeks. Now it looks almost the same as the ‘good’ side. I love how it has the red ‘target’ laser to pinpoint where the treatment is going and automatically starts when touching the skin and stops when removed. Slick and small design, doesn’t stand out on your counter as some strange device, and is very easy to use.

I am currently on my second bottle, and I am also taking Moody Bird. The two together feel like a great combo to help those with hormonal acne issues, but I wouldn’t say it’s going to magically fix all your acne woes alone. I tweaked my diet and water intake and am being more conscious about my stress levels. I’m also using Murad acne body wash on my face with my Clarisonic, Herbivores’s balancing toner, Dr. Dennis Gross’ clinical peel and a Clean and Clear salicylic acid moisturizer. Those acne dots and dark spot dots are also helping me out. I won’t stop taking these for another few months, and I do think it’s worth a shot in combination with some other products to get your acne under control.

I committed to a 6 month ‘detox’ hoping it would help with the acne. I’m happy to report that the number of breakouts has significantly decreased but this isn’t a miracle product. I have to give credit to drunk elephant tlc, Sukari baby facial and the ordinary salicylic acid too. The detox definitely helps regulate your digestive system. I don’t think I’ll continue it after 6 months unless I notice significant changes. I’ll report back if I do. If you want to try this product I recommend 2-3 months. I haven’t noticed any changes in my skin after the 3 month mark.

I started to take just one a day and it’s been better for me! No pain, no extra bathroom visits, and no more pimples!! My skin texture also feels smoother than before.

The first three weeks were awful but after that my skin really cleared up and now this is the best it’s been in three years. In other regards, I feel less bloated but no weight loss. It seems this supplement motivates people to change their eating and other lifestyle habits but if you already have good habits, it might still have noticeable effects. If you don’t change your habits, you probably won’t see any effects. I didn’t change my habits very much; I eat moderately well and do moderate exercise. Overall, I liked this enough to start a subscription directly through HUM.

These colors and earthy fragrance let’s you know you are getting quality oils that have not been over processed. “B” Oil absorbs quickly on clean skin and does it’s best work at night when your body repairs and rebuilds during sleep. Not all of The Ordinary products are for every skin type but, ”B” Oil is a game changer for all skin types. Use a few drops directly on clean skin and/or combine with your final step moisturizer. My skin absorbs “B”Oil so quickly. I add “B”Oil to my “Buffet” + Copper Peptide and to my final step moisturizer at night where “B”Oil does it’s best work. A little goes a long way! RESULTS: Strange Women are asking me where and what I’m having done to my facial skin! My face glows with health not the slick oiliness I’m used to! Just a heathy glowing skin that produces less oil in my T zone (smaller pores because these pores aren’t full of excess sebum blackheads). My lines and crepey skin is much smoother because it’s actually hydrated. If I found out The Ordinary was discontinuing “B” Oil I would buy cases of the product and store it in a dark, cold undisclosed location. BACKGROUND: I’ve only used products sold at dermatology clinics, until now. I was gifted some The Ordinary products and was shocked by the improvements in my skin in such a short time. I have mature, dehydrated and VERY oily skin. It is difficult to find skin care in this category. I never used skincare oils because of my extremely oily skin even though I knew it would help my dehydrated skin. Dehydration in skin causes dullness, accelerates fine lines and wrinkles, worst of all it increases oil production. These are my opinions and observations of 40+ years of personal skin care and skin care of others searching for the best way to take care of the largest organ of your body.

My usual favorites, Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask and Paula's Choice Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, hadn't been able to keep up. My skin was becoming irritated and much more likely to flake/peel then it ever had. Enter: Kate Somerville. The product has excellent slip, I feel like it's effective with minimal application, and it delivers the results of Benzoyl Peroxide with actual hydration and virtually no irritation. I applied it only to my problem areas for about five days and the appearance change was dramatic. I still had a few small clogs along my jaw line, but nothing like I had been dealing with. Since then, I've treated my forming zits by double cleansing, applying blue light therapy, and finishing with a tiny dab of Anti Bac. And in conjunction with finding good, lightweight moisturizers, I've kept all but the really hormonal acne at bay for months! Super love it. Usage notes: only to apply to affected areas, spot treating if possible. Remember to use sunscreen as this can sensitize skin slightly. Also, I probably wouldn't use if I didn't have results from benzoyl peroxide in the past.

It works great under all my skincare and makeup products and is easy to use before my morning makeup routine. It will dry out your skin if you use it daily for a few days but just make sure to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day to avoid flaky skin. Overall, I recommend this as a solution to help clear pesky breakouts in a shorter time span. It is easy to use and works great with other skin and makeup products so there's no worrying about products piling or this products' effectiveness.

Skin Type Dry",4 stars,"I really like this product for my oily and very acne prone skin. It's definitely super lightweight and absorbs fast, which is always great. I think it works well under makeup, but I can also see how some people would want more moisture for underneath makeup too. I don't love the smell because it has a slightly chemical scent, but I don't hate it either and I'd rather that than artificial fragrance which irritates my skin. It truly is a super lightweight and non-greasy moisturizer that provides a hint of moisture, without being heavy or sitting on top of the skin. It will definitely not clog your pores and it has retinol which is great for acne, texture, and wrinkles. I do not think this will necessarily fill in wrinkles because the percentage of retinol isn't listed, which makes me thing it's minimal, but it will help improve texture on the skin and will help to even out hyper pigmentation while providing a bit of moisture and without causing blemishes. It is definitely not for those with dry or super dehydrated skin, as it doesn't moisturize super well, but for me and my oily skin it's perfect. Of course you shouldn't use this in the morning without sunscreen because it does have the retinol, but I honestly love it both morning and night. I think it's an especially great nighttime moisturizer for acne prone skin since so many of us unfortunate cystic prone people cannot wear anything remotely heavy or overly moisturizing at night without causing problems. Great, solid product. Do I think it will revolutionize/cure all of your skin concerns? No. Do I think it's a great moisturizer for oily skin people? Yes, even if it's just used as a nighttime moisturizer in tandem with other stronger retinol products. Will this fill in all of your wrinkles? No, but it will prevent wrinkles and help even out skin tone and texture, without causing any breakouts. Is it super moisturizing? No, but just enough for my oily skin!

When first using this product it did get a little worst before it got better, so if you are going to purchase or are currently using it, don’t get discouraged! Be consistent and wash your face twice a day (morning/night) with this product and you’ll be amazed! Also, please be mindful of the moisture you use.

I struggle with a few breakouts monthly, but always seem to have at least ONE crater on my face, and always the worst breakouts during that time of the month. This cleasner seemed to work immeditately! The first use it dried my problem areas without the rest of my skin! Plus my skin never felt tight after using so I knew it really was gentle. HOWEVER after about two weeks it completely faded. In fact I seem to be breaking out MORE and in a different way than usual! I always get a large breakout or two, now I get a bunch of tiny whiteheads (and still the big ugly ones)! I tired cutting out other skin care products I used to see if it was something else, but I have't been able to identify a different culprit. This cleasner I think would be perfect if you had very sensitive skin. My oily af skin needs something with a little more elbow grease unfortunately.

I’ve tried so many products on the market. For the first time I tried this cleanser I noticed a huge difference. The skin feels super clean and it has a cooling sensation during use and after. If you have painful blemishes, the cool sensation helps relieve any redness and pain. Also, it’s time release, so it continues to work throughout the day and night. It doesn’t dry my skin out either. Hands down a really great face wash for confused and problem skin. I love it.

You'll see that the scissors are able to push down the inside base post completed use - where-as the Q-tip can't, being too weak.

WORKS FOR ME My 44 year old face with this combo looks like a late 20's to mid-30s. I've gotten hit-on by early 20 yr old guys - so I know it's working!!!! A year ago I stopped this Wrinkle Warrior due to the expense of having to get all-of-the-above noted, along with LINGHZI face masks --- but I'm back because it really did make a final clearing of lines. When I stopped, the smileys came back when I smiled. And I want to smile. :D See what combo works best with your skin .. And hope this experience helps!

Best of all it doesn’t break me out and in fact it’s great for when I do have pimples forming because after using this mask, my pimples are pretty much gone!

First, it is incredibly affordable at under $10. Second, the silicon suspension helps it go on smoothly. But it’s perhaps the strongest concentration I’ve used. At first I had to adjust the amount down to just a drop because it stings a bit. A little goes a longggg way. You should be very diligent with sunscreen when using Vit C. But when I ran out and switched to another brand, I really noticed a difference it my skin texture. To be fair, seasonal changes can influence it but I reordered The Ordinary brand. For $10 you should try it.

It is their strongest vitamin c concentrate so if you are sensitive you probably don’t want to start with this one but if you know your skin can take it go for it! For me tingling is usually minor unless I am braking out and doing a lot of acid peels but at that point everything tingles so it’s all good. I love the silicone base, it kind of a semi putty effect, because of it’s thickness. You do need a lot of sunscreen on top so I don’t do it very often in am, mostly if I am staying in. But it’s great for pm exactly how the instructions say! Love this vitamin c, great sub for the serum

Well, I decided to up my beauty routine and started with a combination of this and the moisturizer used before I go to bed (I have other IS Clinical products I use in the morning to treat my Rosacea and Eczema). WELL, to my surprise, today I was given a compliment about how rested I look given the new baby at home!

I was using the Hada Labo Premium serum for a while, and after removing it from routine, my acne has become a lot better. But I need to add another hyaluronic serum, my skin feels dry without it. This helps keep my skin feel comfortable throughout the day. It's pricey but it doesn't make me break out. I spritz La Roche-Posay thermal water spray prior to application. I use it in the evening and the cloud moisturizer in the morning, I spritz La Roche-Posay thermal water prior to both applications. I layer a night cream after application of this serum and another serum. I may try something different that's more cost friendly in the future once I figure out what works with my skin.

I like to use a simple skincare approach and focus on moisturizing to keep my skin healthy. I'm used to direct acids and currently use TO's Glycolic Acid toner and Azlaeic Acid Suspension. This product didn't irritate my skin at all, it's lightweight and I saw fast results after popping a nasty zit on my chin about two weeks ago. The spot was very dark at first but after using this serum daily my scar has almost completely faded. I wish I had found this sooner! I have slight PIH and redness on my cheeks but I haven't paid attention to any changes this product might have made there. I use very sparing drops of this serum and apply directly to any dark spots. I then apply a thin layer all over my face, beware if you use too much it will ""foam"" up a bit and be sticky. I then follow up with Corsx Advance Snail Muccin for my moisturizer which gives my skin a glow that's not oily. I use this in the morning and at night after cleansing (and after toner at night). If you're looking to fade dark spots quickly and brighten your complexion this product is very affordable and worth a try.

NOTHING helped it. I mean, I didn’t really invest in skin care and I would try to go for the more affordable “amazing” products. But now I’m glad I made the choice to seriously invest. Everything I picked out, I did so much research on (who wants to waste money when they’re buying a whole skincare routine at once.) and I don’t regret any of it. ESPECIALLY this one! I will address the issues I see in some reviews: Yes, this is hard to wash off. But it’s worth it. I’m not sure if it actually gets clumped in peach fuzz, I purposely got a little in my eyebrow and scalp to test it out and it didn’t cling to little hairs at all. I seriously observed all of the action as I’ve used this the past couple weeks and from what I can see, I’ve come to the conclusion that this product actually clumps up in my dead skin, which is actually a good thing because it shows that it’s really clinging to it and doing great with removing it. So that whole debate on if the little clumps are dead skin or the product itself? I think it’s both. So, remember I said how my skin was this gross oily flaky texture? Nothing would help it. It got to the point where I was willing to use a washcloth to try and rub the flakes off and id scrub it pretty hard. I was so sick of my skin that I was willing to damage it. Which still didn’t even help. No exfoliation’s, toners, face cleansers, nothing. The very first night I used this, the amount of clumps that I saw was insane! (they reduced over time as my skin came to life)But what was even more shocking was that once I rinsed this off, literally ALL of my oiliness, dryness, and flakiness instantly vanished. My skin immediately became baby smooth. It was actually emotional for me because it was the best my skin has ever looked in my life. My skin never gets annoyingly flaky now.

I would scratch at it to try and get rid of it, but it's such a sensitive area and everything that I could think that might remove it was too abrasive. Anyways, I went into Sephora just looking for an exfoliator to deal with sebum and dry skin and an associate recommended this product to me. At this point, I had totally forgotten about the dead skin under my eyes until I used it and looked in the mirror and the dead skin was gone!

It took scrubbing with a wet ole Henriksen complexion sponge, a dry washcloth and some tweezers to get it completely off. This left my jaw line red and inflamed.

The consistency and the way it feels on the skin is like nothing I’ve experienced, and not in a good way.

Absolutely no burning, but does an excellent job of removing dead skin cells, leaving only smooth and refreshed skin. Don't let the reviews about pilling and getting caught in peach fuzz deter you from trying this product. The peach fuzz balls remove easily with warm water, and the more you use the product the less it gets caught in facial hair. The pilling up is part of the exfoliant process - think of using balled up glue to remove residual glue, and that's pretty much what happens with this product and your skin. Again, this product is AMAZING. Try it!

It smells great, and I feel like it’s a lot more gentle, while still getting the job done. But like many other reviews, it is pretty difficult to get off. It sticks to all of my hair on my checks (closer to my ears) and I almost feel like I have to use a warm towel to get them off completely, but I don’t like to drag a towel across my face because it’s obviously too abrasive. I have found using this product in the shower is better because you can just put your entire face under the shower head to rinse it off. The only reason I can’t give it a 5-Star rating is because of the difficulty removing the product.

This is the first product that really makes a difference in my aging dry skin. I’ve used it directly on my clean face before night moisturizer. It makes my face baby soft the next morning. I’ve also mixed it with my long wear foundation and it helps to keep it a little more hydrated. The routine that really works for me now is as follows: DHL face oil for cleaning, Clinique moisture surge lotion as toner, Dennis Gross hyaluronic marine hydration booster, Clinique Vitamin C serum, Biossance or FAB moisturizer, and Biossance squalene face oil. The texture of this serum is watery so I applied one drop onto one section of my face at a time. Personally, I think this is probably the best serum in the market for addressing issues related to dryness.

I'm fairly sure it was this product that caused me to break out because it was the only change I made to my skincare routine at that time. The breakouts were nothing bad at all, and they weren't really that noticeable, but they were still something I'd rather do without if I can avoid it. I think it might have been that the fragrance irritated my skin a bit since my skin is incredibly picky. But the upsides: this made my skin feel like. a. baby's. bottom. My skin has NEVER been as soft and smooth as it was when I used this. it felt silky and I could not stop touching it. I would say definitely try this out if your skin can handle fragrances.

I only apply it at night, along with matching face cream. I think it does just enough to leave my skin feeling, and looking soft and smooth. I can't say it does much for tone, but I think it does help in pores (just a little). Plus, i don't feel like it overly scented or irritating. However, and perhaps it because I only apply it at night, I don't feel like it is giving me amazing results. (I would say that it has last me all summer, and I still have some left over, so I think I given it relatively good amount of time to do its work.) So, I don't plan on repurchasing this. Plus, it is relatively expensive for just okay results.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"So far, so good. I was looking for a more affordable alternative to the Caudalie Vinoperfect serum, and a Sephora rep recommended to use this the Sephora face oil glow vitamin C. She recommended to use this after washing my face on dry skin, wait to dry, and then use the face oil. Honestly, I really really like it. I should note that I have normal to dry skin and don't break out often. I like to use products that help restore moisture around my cheeks and forehead (they get flaky), and this has been doing the job well. Does it make you ""glow""?? I don't know. I have freckles so it's hard to tell. But nonetheless,this product has a light scent, easy to use, and not bad for $16 for a 2 month supply - and that's if you use it everyday (which I don't intend to, so it will last longer). I've heard of The Ordinary skin line that's supposed to be a good (and cheaper) alternative but was told that they pay for good reviews - so I'm a little scared to try it. There is no doubt that I'd rather pay $16 instead of $8 for a brand I trust.

It's a tiny bottle, but you only need a tiny drop - although the liquid nature makes it difficult to know what a ""pea-sized"" amount is. I went with a dime-sized circle - it was just enough. I recently lost a LOT of weight (110 lbs!), and I need to firm up a LOT of skin, so I had high hopes for this product. It does work; my face looks better; but it is NOT magic, not an ""instant fix"".

I do not suggest using this primer if you plan on being bare faced. It does leave somewhat of a white cast. Primer needs to be spread evenly otherwise you will find patchy spots upon foundation application. I think this is a great primer for people in their early to mid 20s. Sadly it no longer works for me as i enter my 30s. Nothing against the product. Just my skin is changing as i get older and am no longer as oily as i use to be.

However, I feel like it keeps my makeup from going on smoothly at times, because it makes my skin so dry. I normally use a regular primer to smooth out my skin, then pat this on my t zone. The combo of the two seems to make my foundation less cakey. This also works really well for me without make up to control shine throughout the day. Overall, I would really recommend this if you have oily skin (combination skin probably would benefit from a different product).

Unfortunately it did not work at all for me. It pills and causes makeup to go on patchy. I’ve tried it many, many times but I have never gotten it to agree with any of a dozen different silicone free foundations. It also gives me small bumps on my forehead every time - not that uncommon or unexpected considering how much fragrance REN uses. I’ve tried the very similar primer from Ilia and it actually works for me! And it’s entirely fragrance free so no bumps or breakouts either.

It's a liquid, which means it is absorbed easily into the skin instead of simply sitting on top and clogging pores, contains a clean formula so it doesn't irritate, and it's silicone and oil free, so keeps oil at bay! PLUS, it balances out your skin's microbiome, which means improved skin over time, and REN is known for being hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic.

I had resigned to skipping primer, even moisturizer before makeup. The only way I could get 5 hrs even from long wearing foundations, was simply applying makeup directly over a my skincare essence, sometimes using the BECCA matte on my nose. So not using primer for months I expected something kind of pointless but I thought at least the probiotic element would add a nice layer in-between. I thought from the ingredients that it may soothe the skin and provide minimal help with breakouts which it does but what I wasn’t expecting was the wear time that this would add to my foundation, the smoothness, how much it would control oil yet not dry me out or enhance texture. This even, in it’s own way, reduces pores, not by filling them in but by giving the foundation something to stick to so it doesn’t sink in and get all dotty.

I have had other vitamin C serums in the past that I liked better but they came with a higher price tag that I got sick of. Though it doesn't seem like this serum has made me break out or given me any reason to think it's not working, the texture is very odd. It has the ""dry oil"" feel to it that a lot of dry hair oils have. Though it's odd, I can get over that. What I'm not a fan of is that it take a very long time to sink into the skin. If you are getting ready in the morning and need to rush out the door, forget about using this serum. But if you only want to use it at night, it will be perfectly fine. My skin is on the dry side and usually soaks up serums in seconds. This one I usually apply and have to wait about 5-7 minutes before I can move on to the next step. Not a deal breaker, but definitely an inconvenience.

I always add the resveratrol & Ferulic serum to my C. I never had much interest in C derivatives since they all must be converted to LAA blah blah.., til I found out recently about THIS particular oil-soluble, stable, less irritating, dermis penetrating as it is able to traverse the skin barrier, best at collagen boosting (I’m 40), long shelf life, sounds too good to be true vitamin c derivative. So of course I did my due diligence and was elated that TO had one! Yes it looks expensive for a TO product, but do your research: THD ascorbate (one of its many monikers) is not in any product I’ve found under $50-60. The texture reminds me of the hemi-squalane. Like a dry oil. So oily types don’t fear. It absorbs clean. When my skin is extra sensitive, this is the C I reach for. Will it eventually totally replace my LAA? Possibly. I’m still rotating as of now. Oh, and I still add my resveratrol and Ferulic, of course!

I only applied it at night every single day because ive read that applying vitamin c can be slightly harmful when you get sun exposure. its worth a try if you have hyper pigmentation or acne scarring !

I found a sample so I could try it out first. Because there's tamanu oil, I thought that the scent would be nutty. I hate the scent of tamanu oil. It also mentions sunflower oil and ginger so I was like, is it spicy it something? However, the Daily Reviving Concentrate is pleasantly citrus scented. I'd say it's mostly lemon-y. No trace of peanut butter or related foods. The oil has a similar effect as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate. I expect you could probably use either one at any time during the day (don't quote me on that). There are some oils in both that I've read can create damage when exposed to sun, so if it's concerning to you I'd recommend looking that up. This oil mentions that it prevents damage from the sun so maybe it cancels itself out. I don't know. I also need to educate myself on which order to use this with sunscreen. All that said, I love this almost as much as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate, which is to say A LOT. MRC is in my top 5 beauty products. Excited to be able to add a new one to the family!

I had been struggling with acne for a few years after my senior year; I tried everything in the market and spent so much money on different products that promised wonders on my skin. I bought the three-step kit, but I knew for sure this product was the main reason why my skin cleared. I stopped using this toner for a while; I wanted to try a different cleanser(i did not like the cleanser it came with), and the new cleanser and others broke out my skin instead. Finally, I found a new cleanser that works, and along with the toner, it has cleared my skin a lot. Using this toner, you will see the dirt on the cotton pad; if you get pimples well the next, they will be gone, reduced the size or redness. I have bought this item three or four times already; it works guys!!!!!!!!!!.

I have tried Ole’s Truth Serum (sticky but effective), as well as Drunk Elephant’s C-Firma (really like, very effective, not sweet smelling)... I purchased this serum and found it to be pretty oily. In addition, the bottle is not awesome. I’m not sure that it just does not close properly or if it leaks though i had trouble with it often. After placing this serum in my skincare bag after use one morning, I returned in the evening to used it again. All of the serum had spilled out. I contacted Sephora in store as well as their customer service line. I received no help. I contacted Josie Maran directly... also no help. I used the serum only 2 weeks and it was gone with no refund or courtesy replacement. I am VIB and shop Sephora skincare often because I follow the 10-Step Korean Beauty routine. I enjoy the store associate recommendations and love my Sephora experience. This serum purchase did not contribute to that.

However I’m on my second bottle and I love it. When applying it at night before bed I’ve noticed my breakouts where less noticeable and were healing faster. The soapy texture that everyone says they don’t like about it doesn’t bother me because, yes when rubbing it in, it does have a bit of a soapy feel, but it drys smooth and the soapy feeling goes away leaving my face feeling fresh. Plus the smell is nice.

Although I’m 24 and not necessarily too “wrinkly” yet per say, I live in a city where my skin is exposed to pollution daily and spent years without ever touching sunscreen to my face — my skin was starting to look congested, dull, and prematurely aging. These pads were a godsend! My skin is better looking than when I was in college. Its glowing, tight and refreshed looking for the first time, and I rarely break out if ever after two months of using these products. For those of you who like instant gratification, I noticed a huge difference when I woke up the very first time I tried this. My esthetician also highly recommended this brand.

I was using a little everyday as a serum. This was a dream come true. The first couple days I didn't see results, by day 3, acne that had just been ""staying"" around was clearing up. My pores are looking smaller and I now can't wait to use it because I know I will have better skin in the am. I think how to use it is key- at night I put it on clean,dry skin. I use 2 pumps and let it sit for 2-3 minutes while I brush my teeth. THEN put moisturizer on top. The acids/enzymes need time to work before you neutralize them with a moisturizer on top. Then I add a drop of Josie M oil as my eye cream, other areas etc. So it can work well with your current routine. TRY IT!!

I was using Drunk Elephant products (the C serum and Frambos, in the morning on alternating days, with moisturizer after) and a retinol moisturizer at night. I applied this one morning, and loved how it made my skin feel! So I switched my routine around to use the DE products at night, with a heavier moisturizer than I had used during the day (ran out of the retinol, so stopped that for awhile) and this during the day. It's all I need! No extra moisturizing required for my skin. After reading the ingredients list, though, I saw that it doesn't have hyaluronic acid, so I started using an HA serum before this, and let it absorb for a couple of minutes. This product plays very well with my makeup, even though it is silicone free! I was prepared to use a silicone-based primer, but didn't really need to. I don't know if this Tata Harper serum will work as well as presumably stronger products that have been around awhile, like Good Genes, but I hope so! This product does feel kinda similar to GG, but even better. Smells kinda similar but this one smells better and is less noticeable. Definitely dissipates soon after application. I got several deluxe samples, as I was placing several orders from Sephora anyway. If I continue to like this after I'm out of samples (though will save one for travel), I look forward to having this gorgeous bottle on my vanity.

I only apply in the areas I tend to get deeper lines like between my brows, eyes, and my smile lines. Specially I have this deeper wrinkle by my mouth (one side only so it drives me insane). I’ve seen a significant difference. Much less noticeable. But I will say that I have a very extensive skincare routine so I think that also helps. This is just a great addition particularly for that smile line I hate. For under $10, it’s a game changer for me.

Like many have said, it does have the texture of water--the key for me is to use it right after cleansing before I layer on my other products.

However this didn't seem to work any better or improve the condition of my skin any more than the vitamin c serum I was using prior to this one, and that one is only about a third of the price of this one.

Upon the first couple of uses, it really brightened my skin and cleared up some of my hyperpigmentation. It glides on smoothly and has a watery texture. It doesn’t feel sticky. I gave this 4 stars because with continued use, for ME, my skin started to flake, get red and patchy and the serum started to sting when I applied it. I don’t think it’s for people with sensitive skin.

However, i do think there are cheaper body moisturizers that contain salicylic acid that are more effective. For the price, i wouldnt recommend it for KP because you will run out very quickly. But for just spritzing on your back or booty when you are having flare ups, its great and really helps reduce the inflamation. Nice cooling sensation too.

Skin Type Combination",4 stars,"I live in a hot, sticky, urban environment. The summer is *not* a good time for your skin if you're remotely acne-prone. So I went in search of something to use on my back and chest-- adult acne can be pretty embarrassing! I already use Murad gel on my face (for acne control), and it works quite well. Benzoyl peroxide products destroy my skin, so I knew I had to stick with salicylic acid-- which is what Murad products use. My fears: this would overdry my skin; it would bleach fabrics (pjs, sheets); it would be smelly. The reality: it does dry my skin out a bit more than I'd like (that's the docked star). Skipping a few nights every now and then helps with that, though (and my skin is somewhat sensitive). No fabric bleaching! It dries very quickly, so I just spritz it on and give it 30 seconds or so to dry before dressing. It's got an odor, but it dissipates very quickly. It does smell like a ""product,"" but it's not overpowering. The spray bottle is lightweight and easy to maneuver. The spray does not go everywhere-- it doesn't have a wide arc (so less wastage). As I mentioned above, it also dries very quickly. I doubt I'll use this in the colder months, when my skin is dry. In the warmer months, though, this is an essential for keeping skin clear.

My journey started at the dermatologist at the age of 13 where I was put on Accutane.. despite the negative/long term side effects of this awful drug it cured my face acne and body acne for a good 6 months. soon after my body acne came back full force whereas my face acne never returned. I came across this product while searching for something to replace my acne cream that what not working what so ever. After looking into this product I decided to give it a go... I've had this product for 5 days and my inflammation, redness, and acne has been drastically reduced! Although there is still some left I am hoping it will only get better with time! I am so impressed with this spray, I didn't think it would work this fast. My confidence has improved so much and I am hoping this product will continue to work for me! If you are looking for a solution to body acne, mild or severe, give this a go! I cannot say this will work for everyone but it definitely changed my life! I will definitely be repurchasing!

I’ve tried dozens of “peels” but only a couple were really helpful, & they were both discontinued. So with clogged shelves & lots of wasted $$$$$ (oops, I never get around to returns!) I was thinking I’d just have to go pro. But now I don’t. Finally one that works! I got it as a sample, tried it, went to buy it & it was temporarily sold out, which tells me other people loved it too ;) The day after I used it, my husband commented on how nice my skin looks. I would guess this would be too much for some people, and I haven’t tried every Single peel out there (it feels like that tho), but this is the best I’ve found by a big margin. Since I was otherwise going to pay for professional peels, the $90 that seemed kinda steep now seems like a bargain & I’m grateful to have found it. Try it if you need serious exfoliating!

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I have owned and used this peel/mask for a little under 6 months now. I’ve used it regularly once a week or every other week. I like exfoliating and don’t have really sensitive skin so I have a few that I cycle through, hoping to find my ONE. I’m discovering is there isn’t a “1” exfoliator. I want a couple. I want baby facial or goops instant facial on my counter because they’re effective as heck, I like the way they feel, and they’re strong and really good for days when I really need a good hard exfoliation. But sometimes? Sometimes I am on my period, my skin is acting up and puffy and I just don’t want that ‘rip my skin off’ feeling. Sometimes it’s Sunday and I want to mask excessively. Sometimes I want to wear a mask for an hour and not have my family ask me what the heck is on your face. And on those days, this is the one for me. Let me tell you why I love this. 1. I LOVE the smell. It’s lime-y but not overwhelming. 2. It’s creamy and not gritty. When I know my skin is off, I really don’t want to scrub away my barrier with any grit. This has none. It’s like a velvety cream. Because of this as I said I can wear it without being stared at. 3. It’s effective. It’s not as strong as baby facial and it has zero grit to it, but it definitely leaves a glow and I do feel like it’s done it’s job when it’s done. It feels a lot like Tatas resurfacing mask. Gentle, but effective. 4. I love the packaging. It’s pretty and I like having it on my counter. As I said I’ve had it for about 6 months now, it’s less than half gone. It comes with a neat little spoon. It has been something of a task to keep track of that but I have and I’m glad because I haven’t put my fingers in the tub once. Yes this is pricey. But it’s worth it. At this rate I’ll only need to replace about once a year and when it runs out I will replace it. It annoys me how many reviews there are on this product who received a free one two years ago and now there’s barely any reviews on it. Its a good find

I was recommended by Sephora to use this to prevent acne. my skin was so soft after a 20min treatment. when I washed away the peel, my skin felt refreshing! it was brighten right away, and it was so much smoother to apply serum and moisturizer. I believe it is a very concentrated product of glycolic acid then sodium hydroxide. I m guessing that the amount of sodium hydroxide might have assisted the action of glycolic acid, hence making this product more effective than others I have used. that said, Sunday Riley sulfur mask is still more effective for acne treatment. this would be more for regular maintenance.

I like a multi Tasker with lightening properties; some areas of my face have darker patches on the jawline. This serum was successful at preventing my dark patches from showing up again. However it has exfoliating properties, so I can't use it in the morning under makeup. I will return to the Algenist Genius Ultimate Anti-Aging Vitamin C serum or an Origins combo of Mega Dark Spot Correcting Plantscription Anti Aging Power Serum, or a Perricone serum. I like Dr. Gross, but I use this product only at night, now.

I tend to apply it a while before bed so my partner doesn't end up smelling it on me or it coming off on my pillowcases - lol! It does absorb very well. The serum does a marvelous job in helping with redness issues. Super thick texture so you can apply as thin or as heavy as you need to. Product does last. It dries a bit yellowy, depending on application. I would say it definitely requires a patch test due to the strength of the product, but unless you have allergies or sensitive skin you should be OK. Great for improvement of skin's texture regarding pores, but I think the radiance benefit is largely due to it drying in a yellowish tint. Love that it is paraben free, sulfate free!

While this serum hasn't completely cleared my acne, it has helped with the texture and whiteheads. No progress yet on the blackheads. And I noticed my hyperpigmentation has been fading faster, too, even without wearing sunscreen. In conjunction with this product, I also use Cerave's Foaming Facial Cleanser and Moisturizing Cream, as well as the Ordinary's Niacinamide serum. One thing I really don't like is the bottle. It's hard to control exactly how much comes out and it has a tendency to get crusty around the opening. I think this product could have benefited from either a dropper or one of those nozzle tops. Other than that I think this can be a solid addition to your skincare routine if you're looking to incorporate Salicylic acid.

The ingredients in this product are 2% salicylic acid; which helps unclog pores, 1% low molecular hyaluronic acid; which helps hydrates your skin and beta Hydroxy acid; which helps exfoliate your skin. It also contains no parabens, fragrance and they dont test on animals. When using The 1nKey List it starts out kinda of sticky, but as you rub into your skin that feeling goes away. I also notice after applying this product I didnt feel that I needed to use a moisturizer. I like that there was no scent and it help with my breakouts and unclogged my pores. The 1nKey List packaging is very simple. I found it easy to use and dispense. The bottle is small enough to fit anywhere. My overall experience with The 1nKey List is positive.

I have definitely gone through phases with my skin, but consistently for the last year I have been breaking out (no matter what time of the month). I started using this (inconsistently, I might add), and my skin cleared completely within two weeks. Now that I have used consistently, my pores are smaller and my face is like glass. It has also been fading my acne scarring DRAMATICALLY. I did use Mario Badescu's Glycolic Acid Toner prior to this, so I'm not sure if that helped prepare my skin for an acid, but I had only mild tingling when using this product (which has since stopped with continued use). I would recommend this product to anyone. If you're having consistent skin issues - this is an incredible value and worth a try! ALSO - I didn't notice any smell with this (maybe slightly herbal but not bad), and the bottle IS glass so it's probably not the best for travel. (If that matters to you.)

I had issues with closed comedones around my cheekbones for the longest time, I couldn’t fully get rid of them no matter what i used and it was SO frustrating. After randomly coming across this and creeping reviews, I got it, and within a few days i started to notice a difference in my skin. Within maybe two weeks my skin was completely clear and has been since! My makeup goes on so much better now, my pores are minimized, and it completely took care of the annoying {blackheads that aren’t actually blackheads} on my nose too! Definitely one of the few products that i will never stop repurchasing. It burns just a tiny bit for a few seconds when you put it on, more like a tingle, but I honestly like it because I feel like you can feel it working. I also have sensitive skin and this is somehow gentle enough that it didn’t irritate me at all, despite how incredibly effective it is.

This product has not only served its purpose as an exfoliant, but the formulation has done something magical to the brightness and bounciness of my skin. Texture and tone are evened out. My makeup is looking on point on top of my skin, but I’m also feeling confident without a stitch of makeup on my face. This formula is A+. Also love that it’s packaged in black glass and dispenses easily without spilling or dispensing too much... very well executed compared to other acid toners I’ve used. I dispense into my hand and apply with my fingertips. **My husband has very sensitive skin and experienced a little redness after the first use, but quickly built a tolerance for it and now uses it daily as well! He is a chef and this has helped his skin with congestion, clogged pores, and dehydration.

I used to get so oily mid day at work and have to either oil blot or use a facial wipe just to remove the amount of oil my skin would produce, now I barely notice any oil build up throughout the day but if I do I use a face wipe MUCH later in the day than I used to. My acne has become so much more controllable that it’s unbelievable. Spots that used to last 5 days to over a week now pop up and are gone in 3 days or less. This has also really helped to fade redness, irritation and acne scarring that I have on my cheeks and forehead. I’m a guy, and I even pat a little bit onto my neck especially after shaving and my irritation and razor bumps have decreased DRAMATICALLY. This is shaping up to be a holy grail product for me and that price point is truly unbeatable. 100% buying for as long as they make it, just wish they sold it in bigger bottles even though this amount does last a very long time!!!

So I decided to give this a try, and I'm so glad I did. It spreads and absorbs so much more easily, it works just as well, and my breakouts have stopped. And the price is essentially the same, which is absurdly low for a skincare product at Sephora. If you're thinking about giving it a try, just do it.

It's not really suppose to show a huge difference right away. it took me about a month and half to see effect of the corex. it's also similar to the niacinaminde from ordinary, minus the zinc. You just have to be a little careful, because zinc is in a lot of my sun screens, and I get a little sensitive when I get too much zinc on one skin routine.

Despite having acne prone skin, I haven’t used it on any post-breakout hyperpigmentation. I generally prefer to let those heal/fade on their own. I started using it as a targeted spot treatment rather than on my whole face because it caused a few small breakouts when I used it all over. I think it works well, especially for the price. It has a thick gel-like consistency that goes on a bit sticky but dries down to be unnoticeable. Unfortunately, it stinks. Literally. It’s got a smell that brings to mind fake bacon products (think Snausages) mixed with ballpoint pen ink. But the results are enough that I’m willing to put up with it.

My fingers are crossed for even better results in another 2 months. One pump covers my face. I layer this over a hydrating serum and under my night moisturizer. It has a thick gel-cream texture that takes a bit to soak in. The packaging feels really cheap, but who cares if it's working and is super inexpensive compared to all the other serums I've tried for hyperpigmentation. Tranexamic acid is supposed to play well with vitamin C but I've woken up oversensitized the nights I've used one of my vit c serums or vit c oils layered with this. I've also woken up red and oversensitized if I layer this with any AHAs, BHAs, or retinol, so beware and plan to simplify your night routine if you have sensitive skin like me.

I will update as time progresses to see if it is effective with my larger spot. For reference, I have combination/oily, light olive skin with lots of damage from tanning (I now wear SPF50 every day!). The product has a soft gel feel that seems to absorb better if patted in rather than rubbed, at least in my experience. You will probably want to put on a moisturizer or face oil afterward.

If you aren’t using a product properly, don’t expect it to perform properly. Skincare takes time, you aren’t going to slap something on one night and have a new face in a few days or weeks. Now as far as this particular product goes, it’s really excellent. The is a mid weight crystal clear serum that has no scent. In comparison with Farmacy, the ordinary, yttp, and drunk elephant’s acid offerings, it’s right up there and may be one of my favorites overall. My skin is noticeably more glowy since this product and the emerald oil were introduced into my regimen. Please be aware this type of serum is meant to be used as part of a regimen, not alone (so if you apply this by itself, don’t be surprised about you face being sticky). Serums in this family can feel a little tacky after application, but when you apply your next step that feeling will disappear. Overall, I think it’s a good option to reduce dullness and add a little extra hydration into your regimen. I also think the price is decent for what you’re getting.

It claims that it can be used as an illuminating primer and I would have to agree with that. There is an iridescence to this product and it really does look like you’re glowing from within. With an oily skin type, I don’t personally gravitate towards illuminating products before makeup application. However, if you do, this might be a good multitasking serum for you try even though I’m not too sure it actually fades dark spots. It is quite lightweight and it absorbs quickly without leaving a tacky residue. Overall, if you’re looking to try a brightening serum to fade dark spots, this is not my favorite, but if you want a product that gives you a natural glow, this may be it.

The first time I used it was at night as it could be used AM/PM. I saw an instant glow to my skin so I shifted to using it in the AM for a great glow. I just didn’t want to waste that glow lol. I was using retinol with this product and it didn’t irritate my skin (I have sensitive skin eczema prone skin). It goes on smoothly and it smells pleasant. I was using dr Dennis gross stress rescue super serum prior to this and thought the texture was thicker to spread than DDG serum (just for comparison) as it’s not fluid/water like. I hope that makes sense. But it is lightweight on skin once massaged as my skin just absorbs it (combo dry since it’s winter). I usually don’t have to use highlighters when I use this with my coola tinted moisturizer as I get the subtle glow from this. Received this for testing purposes in exchange for honest review.

The texture comes in a slightly denser creamy texture with a very subtle pearly sheen that translate beautifully on the skin, a subtle glow without being too much. It leaves the skin a matte to the touch feel and layers nicely with my other skincare products. Since it has some acid ingredients (glycolic, azelaic, salicylic, linoleic) to help exfoliate gently, I still make sure that my skin is well hydrated before I apply this serum to make sure my skin isn’t feeling tight or uncomfortable. I always woke up with a super smooth skin the next morning and the effect lasted for a couple of days. I don’t use it daily but about 3-4x a week. My make up applies very nicely because my skin was so smooth. It didn’t peel or ball up as well. I highly recommend this serum if you are looking for a soft smooth skin but I suggest you to patch test and make sure to properly hydrate your skin prior to use. Also, don’t forget to use sunscreen!

My husband actually bought this for me for Christmas, and I've been using it since about three times a week, post gym, to make it last. One pump can stretch all the way to my chest, but I never apply this on dry skin to begin with so that's why. My skin loves it, for me it's an extra layer of moisture, with the added benefits of brightening my skin and fighting acne. Literally, hormonal break outside disappear overnight. I've never felt sticky from this like I did with Volition's, but then again the formula is just a little thinner with Farmacy. I'm a forever fan of Farmacy, but items like Green Clean and this serum are the reasons I'll keep coming back because they don't cause me to have allergic reactions like other skincare brands have.

I have an olive completion with yellow(ish) undertone. My skin scars VERY easily. One pimple will leave me with a dark spot for months and if severe, even years.  I had moderate-severe acne as a teenager that's left me with discoloration and some subtle pitted scars. The scars have evened out over the years. I'm 30yo now and I haven't experience any severe breakouts for the last 3 years. However, the hyperpigmentation has been tough to tackle I've used and enjoy other Farmacy products, so I had high hopes for this one. I committed to finishing nearly the entire bottle too. There is about 20percent of the bottle remaining and I can report no change. All in all, it did not leave my skin worse than what I started with. But I did not get that brightness and evenness that it advertised. Pros: it has a nice scent it seems to be quite gentle Cons: not worth the price it applies mildly sticky

I use the extra-strength daily peel four days a week with no tingling and love the results. But with this on the other three days, I get a little tingling and a bit pink and blotchy afterward, but my skin looks amazing the next day. I definitely notice a difference between the two. 2-Do you need to use this in conjunction with the daily peel? I have not used this alone so I can't speak to that, but I love the combination of the two and noticed an improvement once I started using it in addition to the daily peel. 3-Are the cotton balls really that bad? Yes, throw them away. They are vacuum-sealed and will never puff back up. Worthless, and the box could be much smaller without them. 4-Is it worth the price? In my opinion, yes. I had scheduled an in-office clinical peel and cancelled due to concerns about scarring. That series was going to cost at least $450, and this has so far done what I wanted from it. My skin is pretty decent to start, but I had some sun damage and hyperpigmentation I wanted to get rid of. I'm happy with my results using this product.

I have been using expensive products with retinol, Vita C, AHA, BHAs, Salicylic acid, and all those stuff with similar ingredients from different brands but I still could not find something that works for my skin. I could not control my hormonal acnes, and the more I used those products, the more my skin became drier with persistent acnes, hyperpigmentation, and uneven texture. Right after I have used it the first time, my skin started to glow, my texture looked more even, my acnes became calmer, my pores became less recognizable, and I immediately felt so happy about my skin. When I was using, it did not really sting my face but my neck area. However, it goes right away. So I think this is a really nice exfoliator to try.

Being AA I was concerned about ""peeling"" as so many AA, from watching youtube, has had not so good reactions. But these are not extreme exfoliates or peels and more importantly my skin did not peel, at all, but I did see a major difference within hours after using... While using it was like wiping your face with a watery soaked round cotton pad... initially I said to myself, ""ok this is going back"" UNTIL... after I finished and applied my night oil (I suggest using this at night) ... I looked in the mirror and my pores had significantly shrunk in size and my hyper-pigmentation had diminished.. but it wasn't until this morning (FIRST TIME USING WAS JUST LAST NIGHT) i really saw my hyper-pigmentation is nearly gone! This stuff is amazing and soo gentle and non irratating.. but make sure to reapply toner and moisturizer after using.

This expired way before it should have, and using oxidized vitamin C can actually damage your skin. I will never buy this from Sephora again. I had the same issue with the Drunk Elephant C serum ... TWICE! Customer service was appalling, especially since I've never returned anything and I'm a VIB Rouge.

Some don't seem to absorb, or they are oxidized & are not very potent. I have been on a quest to find a product to brighten my aging skin and have seriously feel like I have bought them all; Drunk Elephant, Peter Thomas Ross, Timeless. I bought this one out of curiosity and was slightly disappointed my first couple uses, as my skin broke out and was a bit irritated. But I stuck it out a couple more days and now I am on my third bottle. It is the best Vit.C serum I have used and a definately notice a difference in my skin. My skin isn't as dull as it was, it has brightened and smile lines are less visible. I noticed a difference after the first couple weeks and it is way more affordable than others, which aren't half as good. It is now a permanent part of my skin care routine. I really rely on reviews to guide me in my purchases here and thought I should take the time to write something as it is a really nice product.

It did not irritate or breakout my sensitive skin. The smell is not wonderful, but it’s a Vitamin C and Acid Serum so it is expected. The smell resembles the products that make up the formula, similar to Tarte’s Knockout but much less potent. This serum glides on smoothly and works well with my other skin care products.

Only other option would be to roll directly on your face which sounds a little gross to me. Also, I travel frequently and roller bottles always leak. Even though this would be the perfect travel size, you can’t travel with it which is frustrating. As of now, not sure I’ll purchase again because of the packaging.

I noticed another review that alluded to this same issue -- so I'm glad it wasn't just the unit that I received. Other than that, this oil is magic. Absorbs quickly and makes my face radiate.

This Vitamin C-based Vine(Activ) Serum does next to nothing for my skin, though. I’m a bit over 50, have the usual skin issues that come with age, and thought this line of Caudalie might be a C powerhouse. It is not. I’ve tried it for a few months, but I see only the benefits of the higher-level Caudalie (and Perricone) products. I applaud the company for making a more affordable group of products, but these aren’t a value. You use a lot more, hoping for results, but it seems a waste of money. Also, the ingredients in the Vitamin C Serum and the 1-2-3 Vitamin C moisturizer seem almost identical. Why is this one $50+ and another $30+? I’ll happily stick with the Caudalie VinoPerfect and VinoSource lines. A bit costlier, but they’ve transformed my skin beautifully. Try an in-store sample of the VinoPerfect Concentrated Brightening Essence if you want glow, and dark patch/spot erasure. And the VinoPerfect Radiance Serum? Pure, clarified skin, lit-from-within glow, and pure luxury on my skin. NOTE: Some reviewers have mentioned an unpleasant smell. But I tried three of the four products in this line, and my very sensitive nose can’t detect any odor at all. They smell fine—but it they just don’t seem to work well.

Other eye creams are usually to heavy, are irritating, and provide 0 results.

My fine lines between my eyebrows aren’t as deep and my pores around my laugh lines where they are the most visible are diminished. My skin overal feels more rejuvenated. The only reason for one less star is I do find it a bit drying, especially in the midst of a Manitoba winter (-35C, -31F, plus wind) so I can only use it every second day now. I use Lancer’s Omega Hydrating Oil on the alternate days.

This had a very hydrating formula! I use it every night and then again every morning, first thing in my routine. I am very happy with the way this Q10 performs. I haven’t yet noticed any permanent changes in my skin, but I will keep using it. I love how my makeup applies now, so much smoother.

I switched to the rose deep hydration moisturizer and the combo just didn’t work for me as I still felt dry/tightness around my chin area. I just bought the lotus day and night cream, hopefully they pair nicely together.

Ok, it doesn't matter, but I always know that fresh is very gentle (meaning nothing feels good to me). As a night skin care, there is no comment written quickly absorbed (I am dry skin) but it is not very moisturizing feeling; in the morning, I used it before makeup,after whole day,I feels it was like a good face primer because it helped me control the oil.

It has helped get rid of texture on my face, small bumps, and prevents small acne from developing around chin, temples, and forehead. Make sure to use it at least 1 hour before bed because it is most effective when it situs on your skin versus getting rubbed off when you sleep. Pro-tip: if you have 3 hours in the morning before work/school, I'd also apply it first thing in the morning and then rinse off. Give it at least 2 hours, preferably 3 before rinsing.

I really had hope this product would work but I’ve had better results applying aloe Vera to my face. Yes, I was consistent and showed no results. Good luck to you all, but it really didn’t work for me.

I had weird hormonal acne that only formed on my cheeks. Sometimes cystic, but usually just a cluster of small pimples and it was so ugly lol. I'm 21 and have never had bad skin but it started forming at 19. I cut out dairy and basically everything else people said were bad for skin and it did nothing. Do you know how hard it is to not eat ice cream or pizza? I came across these and was like why not! I noticed a difference in 2 weeks and it completely cleared my acne in a month tops. Not only that, but its keeping it clear! I get an occasional pimple here and there but its gone in a day or two. I will continue to use this until I feel like I don't need to anymore. Sidenote: I also take zinc and fish oil with these daily.(Zinc is amazing for acne. These pills have a very low dose so I take an extra supplement). I hear selenium is also great but haven't tried. I also only take two of these a day now since i'm just trying to maintain my skin.

I got sick of my face getting red at the drop of a hat (I have a touch of rosacea and then things like temperature, alcohol consumption, and stress would make me go beet red) so the lovely associate at Sephora recommended I use either this or Dr. Jart daily. I liked the texture and smell of this serum better than Dr. Jart so I committed to using it every day, twice a day. One pump is sufficient for covering my whole face perfectly, and the smell is lovely. (While it's a 'natural' fragrance, it's still an added fragrance, so my bff can't use it, which makes me sad.) I now use it twice a day religiously and it took 4-6 weeks but now I really don't get red at all any more, in any circumstance. I have the sniffles right now and my nose isn't even red from blowing it so much. I need less redness coverage with makeup and I don't notice a ton of temperature changes either. The bottle will probably last me about two months, but it's worth it to me to continue buying it. If you use it religiously, it will work!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"I became a fresh pressed Vitamin C junkie a little over a year ago. The first one I ever tried was by No7 and it worked quite well at first. After some time though, I wasn’t noticing the same glowing results and decided to look for other options. I’m a Sunday Riley, and Tatcha skincare fanatic, but really wanted to stick to the fresh pressed Vitamin C serums which neither of those companies offer. Connie who works at my local Sephora recommended Clinique’s version to me. I already use their Moisture Surge Eye Concentrate and Clinique ID hydrating jelly and love both so naturally I was excited to give this a try as well. I’ve been officially using their Fresh Pressed Vitamin C Serum now for approximately 8 months and I am still just as happy with the results as I was on day one. The last Fresh Vitamin C I used seemed to stop giving the same results after about five months of use. This product still brightens and boosts my skins appearance. I’ve noticed a huge difference in fine lines and unevenness. My skin glows after every use. If I run out for a few days before I’m able to get to the store to buy more I can tell a major difference in my skins appearance. I’m 42 and honestly get mistaken for being in my early to mid 30’s all the time. I’ve always taken very good care of my skin thanks to my mother insisting I did so starting in my pre-teen years. I know my skin care regimen all these years has been a major contributor in how I look now in my 40’s, but without this Vitamin C serum my skin looks dull. You can use this serum alone although I recommend using it in tandem with your favorite night or day moisturizer at first, If you’ve never tried Fresh Pressed Vitamin C before, because it can cause irritation to some people’s skin as can any new product.

Adding a few drops to my moisturizer daily brightened my skin so significantly that it mimicked the look of wearing a highlighter. Got so many compliments on my skin. The problem is that this product is not sustainable - it's ridiculously priced and only a 7 day use because it starts to oxidize rendering itself useless. Wish there were more Vitamin C booster options in store. I likely will not buy again simply because it's not friendly on the wallet. :(

It is easy to apply; honestly, ignore the bad reviews about that. 1. Lightly dampen your problem area with cool water.** 2. Unscrew the white cap and squirt out a tiny bit (you don't need much) 3. Dab on the cream. It heats up in contact with the water. 4. Screw on the white/blue cap. 5. Rub the ridged end of the cap onto the area with some pressure. 6. Rinse off and apply toner / continue your routine. **The instructions say to put the cream on first and then water because if you're not careful, it will slide off, so you can also do cream first and then water. This is just my preference to feel more of the heat.** I use it 3-4 times per week, and a bottle lasts for a few months. I notice that the creases in my nose are clearer, but I still have daily sebum issues. So, this doesn't solve the problem, just halves it. Overall, I recommend it.

The first time I bought it I didn’t not check but the second time, after I was not getting any product through the pump, I opened it up and the pump straw was bent and split open and there was still a lot of product left in the bottle. Same thing with my third bottle so I think it is a package flaw. Disappointed because this is so expensive.

No, but nothing at any price range (and I use La Mer for my face cream — I’m willing to shell out for something that works) ever has. This serum does lighten them, though, and I definitely think it’s helping to diminish the look of fine lines. I do pat a bit of my face moisturizer over top, as I need a lot of hydration, but when I forget to do that, I find this serum is pretty darn moisturizing on its own. I have sensitive skin, but I’ve had zero issues with this product. Highly recommend it!

My medium coverage foundation covered it perfectly. I am going to try one again tonight but I am so happy with this result!

They have almost no effect whatsoever, and actually made my blemishes look more red! I used 3 on one pimple (1 per night) and it didn’t even come close to disappearing. It also leaves a residue on your skin that’s a little difficult to wash off. They don’t really even contain any acne fighting ingredients - just ingredients to hydrate skin. Don’t bother with these.

I used all of them on the two spots I had and they made absolutely no difference. They seemed to freeze one in place so it didn't get any worse, but the other spot I have had for a couple weeks and it just isnt going away so I tried this on it and it did absolutely nothing. really quite an expensive product and you only get 6 in the package. Not worth it in my opinion. They would also be too small to cover enough of the smaller at the surface acne to make this product worth the price.

Where the product “should be” is where the micro needle area is and that’s where the “product” is inserted into your skin. Now, I don’t know about the other ones like the wrinkle, dark spots, etc, but the blemish one actually worked. I was really skeptical about this and so was my mom but I tried it out. I am SO glad I did. 3 hours after keeping it on, the pimple was GONE. Completely. The skin became a little dry but so what? That’s exactly why moisturizer exists! However, I honestly think that this is over-priced. $18 for 6 tiny patches? Yikes...

My husband however gets Cysts on areas of his body and he happened to get one on his hip a day after we received this product from influenster for free to review. Generally we use a medicated salve that takes a few days to make the cyst come to a head and burst but I put two of these on the area and then covered it with a big piece of gauze before he went to sleep. It worked it’s magic because by morning the gauze was soaked from the cyst popping!!! So I will buy these to keep on hand when he gets ones that are painful and need to be drained which I know is not the intended use but it worked. I personally cannot recommend for normal facial acne since it did nothing but aggravate my skin.

When you remove the protective cover you can actually see the little micro ""needles"" of product sticking out of the patch. This makes it super effective because the product is able to ""stab"" into the inflamed area of skin where the blemish is and really get to work. After using the Focuspot Blemish Micro Tip Patch overnight, I immediately noticed that the pimple I had was about half the size it was the day before and the redness had gone down so much!

Unfortunately, the formula made the top layer of my skin very soft and it easily rubbed off when washing my face. Hard to tell if it would have done that anyway, but it made little, if any, reduction in the size of this zit or any subsequent blemish I tried it on. The ingredients just look like moisturizing ingredients...I would have expected at least a blemish fighting ingredient like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide if this is targeted at blemishes...not just hydrating and soothing.

I'm 52 and going through a stressful period nowadays , plus multiple health issues but despite these factors, my skin looks amazing since I've started using this serum.

I had a sample of it and was able to use it twice a day for about five or six days (about 10-12 uses). I tried it without any other skincare besides a double cleanse every night. It visibly reduced the appearance of my fine lines and created the allusion of smaller pores. It didn’t do quite as much for any full-on wrinkles, but still made them appear somewhat less severe. If you can afford the price tag, and pores and/or fine lines are a problem area of your skin, I would highly recommend. I was sent a sample of this by Influenster in exchange for an honest review.

I love using retinol products in my nighttime routine because it’s one of the few ingredients that delivers visible results, but retinol comes with redness and irritation in most cases. This night treatment has a cream texture and is fragrance-free. Best of all, it delivers amazing results without any irritation. My skin is used to retinol, but I always experience some redness when starting a new product. Not the case with this. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It’s been a month since I added this into my routine and I’ve seen noticeable results. So excited to try more Sobel Skin products.

While I don't mind fragrance in products, this had none, which I found I rather liked. It didn't do much in terms of moisture and a evening moisturizer is needed but the more moisture present the better a retinol works...I'm also a big fan of extra hydration for my skin so I would have used a secondary night cream regardless. The texture is light without a hint of greasiness. All in all, this is a good product that I would consider making a longterm addition to my skincare routine.

I could go on forever but I know sometimes it’s better to summarize.. it’s hydrating, buildable coverage, serum-makeup dual performer, and doesn’t get shiny; or simply the best.

I'm impressed because this thin formula goes such a long way when putting it on with a brush, and even that thin layer (which provides enough coverage of my dark spots so that I don't have to use concealer) was enough to improve my skin. After being a little acne-prone since moving to a car-heavy city, my skin freaked out and I switched to foundations that double as skincare. My other favorite is It Cosmetics CC cream. It transfers, though, so set it or just don't touch your face afterwards.

I have some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from cystic acne that I've been consistently trying to get rid of for about a year now. My skin scars very easily and my skincare regimen has always included things that should have helped to lighten dark spots but I wasn't seeing results as quickly as I would have liked. I searched Sephora's website for a product with hydroquinone and this was a little bit pricey but it was also one of the most highly rated correctors that I saw so I went for it. I purchased this product about 2.5 months ago and have noticed a HUGE improvement in old and new scarring alike. This serum applies very nicely; smooth, not sticky, doesn't ball up, and it seems to work well alongside all of my other lotions and potions. Also, a little product goes a long way so it should last quite awhile; however the exp. date on my bottle is January of 2020 and I purchased it in August of 2019 so that's obviously not a super long shelf-life( I'm not sure if I just happened to get a bottle that had been sitting around for awhile or if that's just the nature of the product) - I do apply it every evening so I'm not too concerned about it expiring before I use it up but just something to consider!

I made alot of changes to my diet and invested time to figure out what items to get to stop the actual acne from forming on my face but knew these marks would always be the thing that made me feel self conscious. My face is definitely more even and I know after I keep using it, it will continue to get better. Make sure you wash your face with a cleanser that works for you and exfoliate to get those dead skills off. It really works.

But the thing is: this is a filler, and much like pore-minimizing primers, the product fills in the fine line to make them APPEAR reduced. The ingredient that makes the tingling sensation is like lip plumping gloss - it intentionally sets off a little inflammation, which causes a tiny bit of swelling of the tissue, which stretches out the line (temporarily). The swelling isn't going to last long, so that's where the filler property comes in. Once you cleanse, the effect is removed. Also, just target specific lines or small areas and pat this into it; don't smear it all over your face to treat All The Lines, otherwise you'll be wasting most of this expensive product. I found it did minimize my crows feet & forehead lines - I use it under makeup. Just don't expect long-term improvement in lines and wrinkles. Docked a star due to the very steep price - it works well enough for what it is, but there are good drugstore fillers that achieve the same result.

I do not have any crows feet or deep seeded wrinkles, just some fine lines from expression on my forehead. And I can see wearing beginning under my eyes but I could easily still pull of my 20’s. The reason I say this is because there wasn’t a lot this product would have needed to do. Really it was just a matter of smoothing out my super fine lines and it didn’t even do this. I would not refer any of my friends to use this item because it really was lacking in the results side.

Since getting my hormones in check, and clearing up my skin, I have been fixing the hyperpigmentation and texture. This improved my skin's texture -- to the point of it being nearly completely healed -- so quickly and effectively I was aghast. It also leaves the skin looking healthy and, dare I say, radiant. If you don't have texture, this is probably not the product for you. You're better off with a basic niacinamide/HA serum. But, if you have pitting or mature skin, you will DEFINITELY notice an improvement in the texture and smoothness of your skin.

Skin Type Normal",2 stars,"Straight alcohol is the sixth ingredient, and that explains why this product is more suited for oily complexions. Upon using this serum, you will likely see and feel an immediate smooth, radiant effect; as I did. Unfortunately, after about an hour, this was very drying (I have normal skin), even with a good moisturizer layered on top. The thing that a lot of people don’t understand is that when straight alcohol is in the first 6 or 7 ingredients of a product, it will dry your skin out in the worst way. Initially, the look is smooth, but it’s really awful, because after long term usage, a lot of problems show up that aren’t so easy to remedy. I honestly believe that a great many reviews are written within the first weeks of using a product, thereby missing the opportunity to measure and report long term effects. Two stars for the first 5 ingredients. *Ladies and gents, please keep in mind that this is my opinion, based off of my unique experience. My last review earned about a dozen Not Helpful votes, very shortly after it was published, and I was stymied as to why my respectful and honest opinion was so unpopular. Not sure why. Please, let’s be kind to one another. We are all in this together. Peace.

I have normal type skin that tends to be drier in the colder months, minor aging concerns, and no major skin conditions. This is a very thin serum that absorbs quickly, and has very little odor to speak of. It certainly didn't hurt my skin, or cause any bad reactions. But it didn't do anything amazing, either. It didn't make it feel more hydrated, or change the look of my skin for good or bad. Perhaps this makes a big difference if used over an extended period of time, but nothing about the sample would entice me to lay down a chunk of money to find out. Perhaps this product is more effective or noticeable on a different skin type (oily or combination), but not mine.

I've followed the instructions for this kit but also supplemented with extra moisture since it's cold and dry out by using the Lapis Herbivore facial oil under the Kate moisturizer during the day and the Olehenrikson vitamin c moisturizer at night. After just a few days following this routine, my skin looks clear and feels so bouncy and soft - I can't believe it. The only issue I have is with the eradiKate spot treatment.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I can only speak to the efficacy of this product as a primer, because that is how I use it. That said, it makes an AMAZING primer. Basically, a game-changer. I'm one of those people that, once I do up my face for the day, I don't touch it up. If things are starting to look creased, loose, or flakey, I'll simply wash it and re-apply entirely. This product eliminates the need for that. It basically freezes my look for hours on end, so I still look fresh-faced even after a long, tiring day. Not to mention, it smells amazing and is wonderfully moisturizing. Gone are the days of having that tortured, dry look that your skin gets after a day of wearing make-up for too long. The only downside is that there is no way to get all of it with the pump once the bottle runs low. I had to break the bottle to be able to use all of the product--and there was still a sizeable amount left in there. So, yeah, as far as formula goes, don't change a thing, IT Cosmetics. But, please do fix the packaging.

I have fine smile lines and I’m very patient when it comes to skincare (and highly skeptical of claims about reducing fine lines within weeks) but I haven’t noticed a significant improvement after 3-4 months. Perhaps the hydration has slightly improved the appearance of my skin and it just requires even longer term use to see a more visible difference but for now I’ll be shopping around a little more.

This creamy serum is expensive at $58 plus tax for one ounce, so I purchase it during special sales and then use it when I know I'll be seen in public. IT Cosmetics' transparency is respected and appreciated, but the list of ingredients in this serum is daunting and can deter scrutiny. (The appearance of wrinkles should blur. Your vigilance and vision should not.) Alcohol is included in the formula, which is not green and clean. (This disclosure may encourage frowning.) If, like me, you don't use Bye Bye Lines Serum frequently (remember, you're not participating in a 10-day trial), you're saving money as well as your skin's protective barrier. Alcohol can actually increase oiliness, so for those of you with oily skin, this can be a concern.

The milia under my eyes are still there, but they've shrunken so much they're barely noticeable. I've also noticed that I get fewer little whiteheads - I used to get them all over my face, now I only have to deal with maybe 2 or 3 at a time.

It does have a slight 'manly' smell during application, but that quickly dissipates. I find that one full pump is perfect for covering my face (even around my eye area). And I use another half a pump to cover my neck. It does have a bit of a 'slick' feeling during application but the serum sinks in within a minute. A bottle lasts me 6-9 months so this product is pricey but definitely worth it compared to other higher-end brands. If you don't like the idea of committing to a $60 serum, try one of their mini sampler kits that contains this product.

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"I LOVE this spray! I bought the mini and am waiting for the full size to be back in stock to purchase it because I go through this! I wouldn’t call myself a germaphobe, but I do always carry hand sanitizer, I use Lysol wipes everywhere I go and always have some on hand, and I wash my hands constantly. I’m even more particular about the cleanliness of my face, since I’m very break out prone. My skin is clear now, but I take a lot of precautions to make sure it’s always clean, meaning I don’t touch my face ever throughout the day. I work at a coffee shop where there’s a lot of liquids, sugary syrups, and other stuff everywhere that can fly around, and it’s often that I get a splash of something on my face. I carry this with me everywhere and I spray it on afterwards, or even during my break at work to make me feel like my face is still clean before I have a chance to go home and shower and wash it. I also use it during the gym when I’m sweating so I don’t have to wait for an hour long workout session and a 10 minute drive home with sweaty bacteria on my face. For that reason, I ALWAYS keep this spray with me in my purse, backpack at school, in my car, etc. I plan on buying more minis, and the full version to keep at home so I’m never without it. Additionally, my skin is really really sensitive and gets red really easily. Sometimes even washing it too often makes it red (which I avoid doing when I can, but between washing the coffee off my face after work, showering after the gym, then my skincare routine before bed, it’s sometimes inevitable that my face has to get washed more than twice a day). But this spray helps reduce redness significantly and almost instantly. I was shocked & so blown away! I love to apply this after my skincare routine in the morning, when my skin tends to be a little red just from putting on my products, and it almost instantly brings redness down. Long story short.... BUY THIS! It has so many uses.

I’m awed and amazed at this magic ingredient hypochlorous acid and what it does for me. My skin was dry, irritated and sensitive/oily at times to compensate for moisture loss due to winter/central heating. Immediately it soothes and plumps the skin, yet give it a week and my skin was noticeably less red, irritated and overall a bit brighter. The only “negative” that most of the people whom I’ve told to try is the smell. It smells like pool water. I’m not completely averse to it because I kind of like the smell of chlorine (to each his own), but it does quickly dissipate once it’s completely absorbed into the skin. Excited to continue using this product to see what it can really do in a month, year even!

My pores are visibly smaller and the zits dry up right after using it. It doesn't burn and there’s no redness. Will definitely be purchasing the bigger size.

So far I used about six times, as l stay up late all the time I could not say it magically fixed my night owl look, but I did wake up with a bit well rested glow (just not last long...).

I would say I noticed the difference fairly early on, atleast 3-4 weeks into using it. I still put it on, mainly because there are still a few stubborn dark areas around my smile lines that haven’t caught up. Also, I noticed sometimes the gel tends to bleed outside the dark area I dotted it on, and there will be like a halo effect of lighter skin around the spot. Which, obviously I wasn’t trying to do, so I’m having to put really small tiny dots on the inner most dark area. The other thing I noticed, is that as the spots start to fade they also turn a little red, so now I’m seeing more faded red spots than anything. I put on spf 70 everyday before I leave the house just to make sure I don’t cause irritation. But honestly, I think the gel causes irritation anyway, especially if you have sensitive skin. It can sting a little if you have open scar or picked recently. All in all this product is good, it works, and it does as it is advertised. I’ve tried so many other dark spot correctors, Ambi, Clinique, and Proactive to name a few and they’ve never made a difference in my skin like Murad has. I find I’m at a point that I could go make up free on my cheeks, chin, and forehead if I wanted to. I just need these darn smile lines to catch up.

I have used several different pricey products for my pimples and pimple scars and nothing really worked until I tried this. I wear it every night after I wash my face throughly and in two weeks my face is 95% clear of all my scars and I have not gotten a single new pimple since I started using it. This thing really works and i am in love with my face now. I don’t even wear foundation sometimes because my face looks and feels so amazing and soft. Definitely recommend.

Anyway, I really liked the gel but I couldn't use it everyday because I started to get a rash where I was applying the gel (AKA the spot was getting bigger!). I'd still recommend this if you're trying to combat acne scaring because it really does do the trick; just be aware if you have sensitive skin as the healing process will likely take longer compared to people who can use it everyday.

I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts. I have tried everything - moisturizers for oily skin, prescription benzoyl peroxide products, Differin...nothing worked. I didn't see a difference in my skin with any of them. I decided to give this product a try after a friend said that a toner may make all of the difference in my skin. She was right. Since using this product, I have had MAYBE one pimple. My skin is still pretty oily, but boy is this stuff controlling my breakouts. I couldn't be happier. I am having to apply minimal makeup to my skin and feel so much more confident because this product is keeping breakouts at bay. It may be a little pricey but for me it's so worth it.

They say Retinol is beneficial for your skin, so it didn't hurt to try it. I'm going to continue use to see if it does eventually help like the Vitamin C concentrate seems to be. I don't think I'll purchase this one though.

I like the combination of using BP (step 1 and 2, I use step 2 as a spot treatment now) and the toner, which is glycolic acid and other great ingredients like witch hazel. My biggest takeaway is USE SPF after a moisturizer. SPF is an essential component to any skincare regimen, and it was something I was very negligent about using after this product in my 20's. For a few years now have been diligent about it, and it makes a world of difference. The only reason I took one star off is that I wish Proactiv would reformulate this without fragrance or dyes. It's not something I need in a product.

This is a beautiful marriage between complexion product and sun protection, and leaves a beautiful “your skin but better” light coverage finish. I haven’t had any problems with a gray cast due to the sunscreen, but the product isn’t truly “translucent” and only comes in one pale color, which works for me but not for those with deeper complexions (a problem It has somewhat addressed with other products but not with this one) - a wider shade range for a more inclusive product would bump this up to a five star for me.

I only used one light layer and finished with powder. I really like how light it feels on the skin. I did not want to ""build coverage"". Initially, it looks great. However, after a few hours, it turns much darker, almost ""orange-y"". I have a Fair/Light complexion. I don't see how those with Porcelain/Fair skin would be able to wear this, since it turns dark. Someone with Light/Medium or Medium would find it too light upon application---but since it darkens, it may work, but cannot guarantee absence of ""orange"". Also, after wearing this for 2 days, I had a completely new breakout along my cheeks and jawline, the chin, and around the nose. I don't know if it's the sunscreen b/c that's usually a problem for me. The only one that I can wear is Dermalogica's Sensitive Skin Shield (SPF 30). I really wanted to find one with SPF 50 and I thought the Anti-Aging Armour would supply that, while giving me an opportunity to not wear full foundation. If they can come up with more shades and figure out what would cause the breakout, I may try it again. Unfortunately, this current formula is going back to the store.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I truly love this beauty fluid and consider it one of the best purchases I have made in awhile. I think my only complaint would be that it is a rather small amount of product for the price, but I overlook that due to how great it is. I use this as my SPF after I put on moisturizer every morning and prior to putting on primer. Although to be honest, it really does have the consistency of a primer and probably could be used as one as well. Although the skin tint appears to be a bit light coming out of the bottle (I have a medium skin tone), it blends in beautifully. It provides very light coverage, perfect for those no makeup days. I would say this is a very light fluid that goes on smooth, doesn't feel greasy, and blends in well with foundation if you choose to wear it. I do not break out from this product despite having acne-prone skin. It is difficult to ascertain if this is the one product that is ""perfecting"" my skin, because I am using so many different skincare products right now, and used in conjunction with one another, they all seem to be making a positive difference in my skin. But I love the overall look that this fluid gives me. As far as how effective this SPF is in the sun, I cannot really attest to that yet since it is still winter and the weather is cold where I am, so I am not spending much time outside. However, I am sure it is helping to protect my skin since I use a retinoid serum nightly. Overall, I highly recommend and will definitely be repurchasing this product in the future.

Skin Type Combination",2 stars,"The real name for Glycerin is Glycerol, identifying it for what it really is – an alcohol (-OL is the ending of alcohol group of chemical compounds). As any other alcohol, Glycerin is a degreaser – it absorbs lipids (oils), and removes them from your skin. Many people mistakenly think that because Glycerin has a sleek feel to it, it must be moisturizing. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The sleekness of Glycerin is a result of the length of the molecules. They are much longer than regular alcohol (rubbing alcohol, for example) and therefore feel differently. To explain how drying Glycerin really is let’s just mention that it has 3 groups OH, the degreasing groups, while rubbing alcohol only has 1 group OH. So, Glycerin is much stronger than rubbing alcohol in its degreasing, drying action. Strong collagen in your skin is what prevents skin from sagging and developing wrinkles. Collagen is built from lipids. So, your skin needs lipids to remain looking young and firm. Glycerin robs your skin of its lipids, removing them when you remove the product off your skin. Instead of helping your skin, Glycerin deprives it of much needed lipids and we see the collagen levels drop, creating wrinkles and sagging.

This product won’t make your scars fade or even tighten your skin but the vegetable glycerin will provide deep deep moisture. It’s non sticky and my skin won’t feel tight. I would use serums, oil and moisture but my skin will skill get irritated and dry but this product has changed my skin. I don’t need to use heavy creams anymore and I just need one serum for aging and sun spots (vitamin C). I stopped using it for a while thinking that it didn’t make a difference but my skin began to crack again that I started to get scars that look like stretch marks on my face from the dryness. I know it’s kinda pricey but it’s definitely worth it for those who get dehydrated skin no matter what.

On a really bad note, I used this in combination with the calendula foaming cleanser, the dark spot corrector, and the brightening moisturizer and I broke out in a combination of massive and microscopic cystic bumps/ache all over the lower half of my face in just 4 days. In addition, it also looks like I've gotten a chemical burn, as my face has darkened and has light and dark areas around my eyes and cheeks. Furthermore, my pores are huge, and my face now has a bumpy texture. I'm not saying this all came about from this product alone, but I want you all to be wary of all of these so called hypoallergenic products. All this damage occurred in just 4 days--not cool. I returned everything but now I am left with dark spots. I've never experienced a breakout of this magnitude. I usually only get one or two bumps.

So for your face, I would say it’s a take it or leave it product. However, a sales lady at a L’Oréal outlet store told me that it’s gentle enough to use under your eyes and that’s where it shines. And she was right! I’m currently using it as an eye serum or sometimes by itself and it is SO good! It really boosts my dehydrated eye area and is a better alternative to the Shiseido eye concentrate serum (also a good product but I would recommend this more). It’s a good travel product for short trips where you don’t want to pack a lot since it can double as eye and face care. Just bought another bottle during the sale!

I used half of one of the sample pouches on my face, so really used a generous amount and WOW, I was glowing, hydrated, dewy and flawless. When I saw the cost was $59, I was hesitant at first, and I definitely won’t buy this again. Two pumps really does nothing for your skin, and it’s hard to justify using more at that cost. You want it to last! I haven’t seen any crazy dramatic difference, but I do love how it feels and the appearance it gives my skin. If this was $25-30 I would buy it consistently, but I can’t justify the price for the less than incredible results. I live at 7,200 ft elevation, and it’s super dry up here, so this has definitely saved me and I have used it both with makeup, without and at night, and consistently get soft, hydrated skin. It pairs well with a moisturizer if you’re really needing some hydration, but it’s almost just a fancy primer under makeup. If you’ve got the extra cash, I’d definitely recommend trying this product! The only real negative is the cost.

I pair it with the moisturizer from this same company but I think you can get away with just the serum if you don't want to shell out extra cash. Anyway, love love love this product!

Thinking it might be the an error with the combination of my moisturizer, I tried the serum by itself tonight and everything is sticking together!! It’s a strange and uncomfortable feeling. For this reason alone, and that my face feels dry and sticky-I will never buy this product again. I have extremely dry, blackhead prone skin, and was told how many people with aging skin rave about this product... but that won’t be me.

Believe me I tried a lot of products and wasn’t satisfied with any of them. Then I found PTR 21 peptides serum. Wow what a game changer. The crepiness disappeared altogether. My skin looks moist and vibrant. I have used it everyday since and my skin has never been better. I live in a dry climate at over 6400 feet, of which can’t be good for your skin.

It does seem to have the same basic efficacy as the Unwrinkle, but I don't feel like my skin has the same luminosity as it did with Unwrinkle.

I am new to skin care and bought this product as preventative aging regime. I am 30 and wanting to invest in a skin care routine. I have used this product for a few weeks now and it has worked wonders!! I apply right before bed after washing my face and apply a moisturizer after (they suggest twice daily however). My skin now looks incredibly softer and almost no breakouts. My boyfriend has also noticed a dramatic difference. I predict the reason it works so well is because the product is providing my skin the vitamins it has been lacking and the peptides are helping repair my skin overnight. similarly to taking vitamin pills targetted to hair and nails etc. Product is slightly sticky on the face but barely noticeable and worth it. this product is definitely on the more expensive side but so far it has been worth every penny. I like that it provides both peptides and vitamins A,C,E. Not sure how this product works on wrinkles however. Bottle is heavy and I've read other reviewers say easily breakable.

I'm 60 years old (male) and lost skin elasticity on my neck but not my face (I started daily moisturizing my face when young but didn't start moisturizing my neck until late 30's). Before starting to use Peptide 21 Serum, if I pinched my neck skin it took 3 seconds for the pinched skin to completely smooth out. After using this for a week, a pinch on my neck flattens out immediately. After the trial size ran out, my neck skin reverted in a couple of days. On a per-ounce cost basis, this is the most I've ever paid for a skin product. But I'm no longer afraid my neck shows my true age. My moisturizer is very light and leaves no film, but when applied over this product it leaves a slight stickiness to the skin all day long. The feel reminds me of glycerin (main ingredient of this product and one of the main ingredients of my moisturizer). I don't mind it on my neck. It does have a never-quite-dry feeling because glycerin attracts water (even from the air). I think this is one of those products that greatly benefits skin in need of strong support, but if you're young and have great skin, it's probably overkill.

The crystal exfoliator in the jar has a medium-fine grit texture which is nice and uniform throughout. I like using a nice facial oil after I use this exfoliator and I find that it sinks into the skin so nicely. The one aspect I don't really like is the salicylic activating gel. Maybe I'm not using enough of it but I don't find that it foams up on my face. When I first touch it to the crystals there is a little foaming action but as it try to lightly spread it over my skin the foam pretty much dissipates and I'm left with a more opaque crystal mask. I do like the results I achieve after each use so I may rebuy this, not sure yet.

You usually feel/see something, you at least see you have a product on your face. But, with this, it's like I put air on my face. When you touch the skin-you feel nothing. No softness, firmness, oiliness/dry skin, nothing! When you wake up next morning, same. I decided to finish the bottle, just because I payed a lot, and couldn't return it, and who knows, a miracle might happen. Although, I wasn't expecting a miracle when I bought it, I expected something! But no. I feel so stupid.

It was looking tired, and was developing wrinkles, dark spots, and texture from many decades of Gulf Coast Texas sun damage. About a month ago I began using the Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel. Did the peel for two weeks, then started alternating the peel every other night with this ferulic and retinol serum. (I never use them together on the same day.) Already the improvement in my skin is AMAZING - it's smoother, looks healthier, and wrinkles and dark spots are diminishing. And my face isn't as dry as it was. I keep touching my skin because I can't believe how good it feels. Can't wait to see how it looks in another month. (I use these products on my face, neck, and upper chest; as well as dabbing on the back of my hands to get rid of the age spots there.) The scent of this serum doesn't bother me at all. It's from the ferulic acid (to me it's a very faint somewhat metallic smell; I've smelled that in other skincare lines that used this ingredient). Ferulic acid has very strong benefits so the good definitely outweighs any bad. Again, I don't find the odor offensive at all. My only regret is that I didn't find these products sooner. Sure, they're not cheap but they definitely deliver.

Skin Type Combination",3 stars,I was disappointed in this product. I got the moisturizing base with anti texture serum and it’s so light weight it doesn’t moisturize well at all. The two formulas don’t blend well together and sit on top of the skin for a long time which makes it annoying as a first step under makeup. Also it has a tendency to break me out. Love the concept but ultimately not worth it.,https://www.sephora.com/product/clinique-id-your-custom-blend-hydrator-for-pores-uneven-texture-P439648?icid2=products%20grid:p439648

Skin Type Combination",1 star,"I bought the blue cartridge with hydrating jelly during summer thinking it would help with my pores and uneven skin tone & texture as well as be a light weight moisturizer for my oily / combination skin. But I was super disappointed. Even though I love a few of Clinique products (esp Total turnaround night moisturizer), this one did nothing what it claimed. No difference in my skin texture and pores size and the hydrating jelly is not moisturizing at all. I even tried using it with Clinique dramatically different moisturizer, but the blue cartridge still failed to work magic (the dramatically different lotion is amazing on its own though). In short....the blue cartridge does not do what it claims.

Skin Type Dry",4 stars,"I purchased this cartridge and three others 6 months ago when they were released because I love the ideal of just a tab of serum with a great moisturizer to use twice a day and you don’t have to open up another bottle! I’m doing a review on two of these cartridges. The blue one I thought I’d have the best hope for. I have uneven skin texture and with the concentrations of alpha and lactic acids I thought wow ok. Every morning and evening I wash my skin and use the jelly moisturizer with this cartridge or the tired skin one or the brightening one and layer a cream moisturizer over it. My pores are much smaller, but my skin texture isn’t that much improved. I will say I was really and very opposed to taurine added to these cartridges, but I did purchase the tired skin/orange pump and that one I have seen noticeable results! I am half way threw all my bottles but one and I would say I would keep using theses for daily use. I would recommend for more immediate results bump up your exfoliation if you hold onto dead skin cells like I do and to help the active ingredients to sink in better and to also use spf everyday!

My review is a bit lengthy but I talk about the hydrating jelly and the cartridges separately to give more insight on those who need help choosing. Hopefully my review may be of help to someone! (1.) HYDRATING JELLY : the BEST lightweight gel moisturizer ever. My skin can't handle heavy creams and every other gel moisturizer wouldn't keep me hydrated. This keeps me hydrated all day and gives a healthy glow, not greasy looking. (2.) BLUE CARTRIDGE : absolutely AMAZING. I literally already see a difference in my skin after about 2-3 days of using this. The texture of my skin is evening out and my pores seem visibly smaller. (NOTE : my skin is fairly clear so this could be why I notice changes so fast.) I also see a difference during makeup application. I use this as moisturizer and primer and it makes me look so smooth and flawless. (If you plan on doing this, maybe pair this with other primers for certain concerns such as longevity and creasing.)
