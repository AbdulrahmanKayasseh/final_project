I bought the big bottle and haven’t looked back since, now this is the only cleanser I’ll use. I used to get little pimples all over my forehead and ever since I started using this (a year ago) they went away and haven’t returned. While I can’t speak for everyone’s skin, this was a miracle product for clearing my complexion and soothes my facial redness each time I use it. Im in love.

Finally i couldn’t take it anymore, I stopped using it, went back to my cerave hydrating cleanser- and Bam! My skin was clearing up every day after that. I suggest getting the small bottle to try it out first. Remember everyone’s skin is very different.

(A quick google search of any brand will tell you if they're actually cruelty-free, don't just trust what a company says on its site, there are very loose rules about a company being able to claim they're CF on their marketing material) I use Farmacy Green Clean to thoroughly remove all my make-up before using this, if you wear long wear makeup you may want to do the same. I follow with their Dream Mask at night and Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream or YTTP Adaptogen Cream in the am. I recently moved to Chicago from California and my newly dry winter skin is happy once again :)

I have many of their products arriving in a few days to begin updating my skincare regime, and I was about to include this product in that order. However, upon further inspection of the ingredient list, Rosa damascena flower water is listed as the third ingredient!!!! This is a highly irritating fragrance and for people with sensitive skin such as myself is an ingredient that should be avoided. If they choose to reformulate without this and the other fragrances in the toner, I would be happy to try it out. But a bottle with probably close to 5 percent fragrances? That is not beneficial to the skin, let alone for a leave on product. :/

Recently, I started using retinol and wanted to try a new face cleanser because my was drying my skin even more after using retinol. I don’t understand how this product can have such a high rating. Before using it, I decided to read the list of the ingredients and several of them are carcinogenic or may be carcinogenic (Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Disodium EDTA, ...). I don’t how good of a skin product it is as I haven’t even used it, but based on the list of the ingredients it is not a safe beauty product.

I’ve tried prescription topicals, diets, supplements, a myriad of face washes, skincare systems and spot treatments, adapalene, etc. I’ve tried almost everything. I think the issue is that my skin is not at all oily, but instead is dry and sensitive, so most acne products just make it worse. Then I found SKII. In combination with Shiseido Ultimune, used daily for about 3 months, I’ve noticed an improvement in texture/scarring, discoloration and dryness. My skin responds to almost nothing, so for there to be a visible change at all is incredible. I think it’s the fungi that are in both products, honestly. I highly recommend this if your skin is sensitive, aging acne prone. If nothing else works, try this. I feel like people who are blessed with naturally clear and generally balanced complexions may not notice much of change, but for those of us that continually struggle this is a godsend.

There is a slightly fermented smell that is intolerable to some, but honestly fades within moments of application. It has a watery consistency and did keep my skin feeling soft and balanced over the years, always ready for my serums and moisturizers. However, the reason why I am discontinuing my usage of this product and only giving it 3 stars is that it is simply too expensive for what it is. The main and honestly only noteworthy ingredient in this product is pitera, which is a fermented product of yeast, with proven benefits to the skin (from limited research that was conducted by the company that owns SK-ii). And that's it. At less than half this price point, you can find all kinds of Korean and Japanese essences and toners that are packed full of other goodies like antioxidants, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is a great product! But after having used it for all these years, I do not think it is worth the luxury price tag. But if you do find yourself loving pitera, I would recommend that you turn to the SK-ii facial clear lotion toner, as there are additional AHAs in there (in addition to the pitera) to make the price tag more worthwhile.

I woke up the next morning with a much better looking face. It was smoother, less red, and majority of my pimples were gone. It is different than other scrubs I have used in the past, since you put it on dry skin, and then wipe off with warm water. I’ve also never used an enzyme scrub before but I love it. It also smells nice too. When I put it on for the very first time and took it off I did notice my skin was a little irritated and red by my cheek bones. I have sensitive skin and was worried that this would be the first and last time I got to use this product, but I’m so glad it wasn’t! Since then I have been running a little less in that area and I’m not having any problems with skin irritation. The only problem I’m having is limiting myself to using it only twice a week!

It's a scrub with a gentle peel for your face 1-2 times a week. absolutely loved the idea of pineapple and papaya enzymes as a scrub. I use pineapple for everything, health wise, so why not on my face. My skin immediately looked brighter and felt smoother after I rinsed all of the ""gunk"" off. My face was instantly radiant. I even got compliments from my household members about my glowing appearance. I officially turned them onto it. It's interesting because you always look for scrubs that give you the ""appearance"" of glowing skin, but this one actually does the job. I even decided to try it on my lips just to see if it would work and it did flawlessly, removing dead skin and making my lips smooth and kissable. For this price point and a little going a long way, this scrub is well worth the money. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind spending a pretty penny or a great scrub.

I would describe the “scrub” part as very small micro beads so it leaves the skin feeling very smooth. I have sensitive skin and it does not leave me red or irritated. When using this product, I noticed that it was definitely removing dead skin cells as I could actually see them clumping up. At first, I thought something was wrong but then I realized it was actually dead skin cells! Once I washed my face, I was left with a matte smooth surface. You absolutely need to moisturize after using this. I would have given it five stars if it smelled like pineapples.

I’ve been using the hemp wipes at night when I’m too lazy to do anything else, even skipping moisturizer, and they leave my face really soft and clean in the morning with no dryness. For any of these, if you’re removing a lot of makeup and mascara, you may need two wipes to effectively clean. Definitely would recommend any of the ones I’ve tried with hemp being the best in my opinion. Trying grapefruit and papaya next probably.

It’s so gentle and gives your skin a great clean and very spa like experience, yet I don’t feel like my skin is stripped or dry after. The little beads are so gentle and you can barely feel them. I really have noticed a difference in the amount of blackheads around my noise and my pores seem smaller(which I know they can’t actually get smaller, but maybe less clogged). Highly recommend trying this if you have combo/ oily skin and are break out prone. I think sensitive skin and reactive skin would also love this because my skin will breakout in bumps or a rash and even acne if it does not like a product I put on it.

It took me a little while to want to use it since I had used another Drunk Elephant product that my skin did not like. I went on a trip, which normally causes me to break out. I took this mini with me for convenience. I ended up not breaking out at all. Not even a little bit. When I got home, I kept using the mini alternately with my Boscia cleanser. My skin looked and felt great. I ended up ordering a full size. I still use it alternately with my other cleanser. I like how soft my face feels after I use this cleanser. It seems pretty gentle, so if you have sensitive skin, this might be a worthwhile try.

I find other physical exfoliants use products like walnut shells and coffee groundings - which do not grind to the same sizes AND do not break down with water. This can be very dangerous when your just scrubbing your face with it and if your anyone like me you go to town with exfoliants. This rice powder is gentle, safe and gets the job done. It’s well worth the price point because since it comes as a powder it lasts longer than you think as you use so little compared to a gel physical exfoliant! My favorite tatcha product!

Stayed with it because my extremely sensitive skin (break out prone, dry, etc) was happy with it. And it does a good job of cleansing without drying out. This is scent free but it does get slightly foamy/sudsy if that is a thing for you. Tip -- buy the mini. The large lasts so long (even with using on my face, neck, decolletage and back) that by the time I reach the end of the big tube mildew starts to form around the cap.... ew. No such issues with the smaller size. Value per ounce is about the same so I just buy 2 mini tubes at a time instead. Due to the sudsiness, I have now switched mainly to the YTP Superfood Cleanser.

As a bonus, the scent of this Super Amino cleanser is so refreshing and relaxing, it’s perfect both at night and in the morning! I think the best way to use this product in your morning routine would be washing with 2-3 pumps, applying a nice layer of the CC serum, and topping it off with sunscreen.

This bottle is beautiful glass and is recyclable through Summer Friday's recycling program (see their site). The pump works well and 3-4 pumps is more then enough product for cleansing. While cleansers can be great at removing make up, double cleansing is always where you'll see the best results. If you wear a full on foundation and contoured face it would be in in your best interest to use an oil based cleansing product prior to allow this amazing cleanser to work it's magic on your skin! This gel cleanser is light on foaming up meaning it won't strip your skin of natural oils. The scent is light and pleasant, not at all over powering.

That being said, this toner along with OLEHENRIKSEN face wash are now staples in my daily skincare because of affordability and quality. I do splurge on skincare, but this is one of my MUST-HAVES.

In all honesty, I was kind of skeptical trying this at first because I’ve never tried an exfoliant like this before. It is very unique as a half teaspoon of this rice powder is supposed to get poured into your wet hand, and then rubbed together with your other hand to form a paste. I had doubts that it would lather, but it did, and more importantly felt great on my face. The powder itself was mostly powder with minuscule grainy pieces of rice, I am assuming. The grit itself was very fine though and did not feel rough on my face. I can see why this can be used on a daily basis. Ultimately, I really liked this product and would buy it. It felt very calming to my skin and my skin felt super smooth afterwards, which is great because the cold weather has left my skin chapped and peeling in various spots on my face before using this product.

I really like this exfoliant because the beads are micro and not too big like some others that I have tried, it’s like a powder. Because of this, it is not too abrasive on the skin but gentle enough to use every day. I use it about twice a week because I also use a chemical exfoliant, and using it daily would be too much for my skin. I also love the ingredients, like salicylic acid, rice enzymes, White tea and licorice for brightening, and oatmeal and Allantoin to calm the skin. If you like a physical exfoliant and you haven’t tried the micro exfoliant, I would definitely recommend this one. I just put my daughter on to this exfoliant because she has dry skin and it’s been peeling a lot lately. One bottle lasts for months.

I saw all the reviews about your face feeling so so soft, but didn't believe it until I tried it! It's hard to explain, but it's so true. My face felt very clean afterwards as well. My only problem is that my face was extremely sensitive after I tried it (I used it correctly) and every product that normally doesn't hurt my face was stinging and I had to put my face in front of a fan until the stinging subsided. My face is also sensitive due to using tretinoin (2 months in) so if you are using strong topicals, I wouldn't suggest using this until your face is more ""normal"" and not as easily irritated. Definitely going to try using again later on, but I wanted to warn anyone who is possibly in the same situation.

I'm fair with dry skin, but can break out with many cleansers of which I've tried them all, from gels to lotions to cleansing oils, but most either break me out or leave my skin feeling dry and stripped. After 5 days of the Squalane Cleanser, it has not caused any congestion and it leaves my skin feeling healthy. Some reviews didn't find it easy to use, but it hasn't been a problem for me. I use a nickel sized amount and rub it all over my dry face (you don't wet it first) and just keep lightly rubbing it all over until it becomes like an oil. I then rinse with water or use an Aveda shammy to remove the product. I'm thrilled with this. If you have dry, sensitive skin- you have found the perfect cleanser.

This works perfect to break the make up on my face down and prepare my face for another cleanser. You can’t cleanse and remove make up in one step, it just doesn’t work. This doesn’t irritate my eyes when I rub off my mascara and it’s so gentle. This product is better for the environment than a make up wipe but does the same removal job.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"I do not use makeup wipes on my face. So double cleansing has become a staple in my skincare routine. Double cleansing is better for your skin and the environment, so it's a win-win situation. I enjoy using balms as well as cleansing oils for the first step. I like to rotate because different products provide different benefits. With all that said my number one makeup remover is tatcha. The main reason it's number one is because of all the brands and different types of makeup removers, its the most efficient and easy to use. The only bummer is, it's kind of expensive, but you get what you pay for in life. The scent is very faint, I'm okay with that. With some cleansing balms, they become milky and get kind of messy and you see and feel makeup running off your face. Or they go on really oily and thick. Some cleansing oils aren't necessarily strong enough so you end up having to really rub. Here's where tatcha comes into play, the first time I used Tatcha I was nervous because I didn't see makeup running and there was no milky residue. So I was concerned with whether or not it worked. The make-up just came off with no mess or fuss , I wasn't used to that kind of symplicity. I realized every ounce of makeup was off my face. I was amazed at how clean and efficient this product was. This product is not greasy, It goes on lightweight and it basically feels like nothing's happening. Yet everything comes off your face, it is seamless. The only other cleansing oil that comes really close to tatcha is Boscia, it's a close second but very nice too. However, tatcha is king.

Skin Type Normal",4 stars,"This oil cleanser does a wonderful job taking off makeup and sunscreen at the end of the day, and the pump packaging is extremely convenient and hygienic. However, I have noticed that if I do not follow up the Tatcha with a second foamy or gel cleanser, there is a slight oily film left on my face that I'm not a huge fan of. Perhaps this would work as a 2-in-1 cleanser for someone with more dehydrated skin or is transitioning away from very stripping cleansers/treatments? As someone who already layers on hydrating essences, serums, and moisturizers, I typically like my cleanser to be a bit more thorough. But not too stripping! If your cleanser is making your face squeak/tight, then its too much for your skin and you definitely need something gentler. I would recommend people who are experiencing issues with this product to follow up with a second cleanser, as not everyone's face responds positively to rich facial oils. Although facial oils higher in oleic acid (like the camellia oil used in this product) are richer and more moisturizing than oils high in linoleic acid, there is an increased (but not guaranteed) risk of clogged pores. But if you know that your skin enjoys facial oils high in oleic acid, like olive, avocado, sweet almond, etc., then maybe this could be your HG 2-in-1 cleanser! However in my case, as a makeup remover alone, I would give this oil cleanser 5 stars, but I am knocking 1 star off simply because of the price. As a 2-in-1, I might be able to justify the price, but definitely not as a stand alone makeup remover.

This has all the benefits of oil cleansing without any of the mess. The product smells wonderful—just a light scent—and easily breaks down makeup. The best part? It emulsifies when it touches water, making it easy to wash off. My skin feels hydrated afterwards, but not oily. The product also lasts a lot longer than you think. After a couple of weeks, I went out and bought another bottle thinking I would go through this one quickly, but my first bottle lasted me almost 9 months with almost daily use. The pump on the bottle makes it easy to dispense the correct amount, too. I only wish Sephora sold a travel-size version of this product, as it's a bit cumbersome to travel with.

My mom (who is 72) asked how this is different than a cold cream. This is not as creamy as a traditional ""cold cream"". It is a thick ""balm"" that leaves a thin film on your face and is very easily washed off with water. I follow with a simple cleanser (cetaphil is my favorite), to get any remaining residue off.

For this reason, I usually only use this in the shower & use a different cleansing oil if I'm taking my makeup off at the sink.

A huge feat for my insanely sensitive skin. This is only of the only products I use that is not explicitly clean as I've done for over a decade now -- which is telling. I just couldn't part from it.

She said she doesnt any more. Just this bottle. Her face looked nice and oil/shine free. So, I purchased the kit. I used the products faithfully and after two weeks, my face started to break out and my shine was never reduced. I stopped using the toner and kept using the other two bottles for 2 more weeks. After those 2 weeks, my face looked horrible and was very irritated. I had pimples and cysts that would not go away. I had to stop using the products. I could barely use foundation. Anything that touch my face made it feel like it was on fire. I had to go to a dermatologist and be prescribed doxycycline and a retinoid cream. After 3 months of that regimen, the pimples and cysts went away. Then, I ran into two fellow nurses who tried this product and broke out and were prescribed doxycycline as well. Don't do it ladies and gents! There's better products out to maintain an acne free face.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I am amazed by this product! I was hesitant at first, as this product has salicylic acid in it and wondering if using it once daily would dry out my skin. I've been using this product for almost a month and I've had nothing but great results. I wouldn't consider myself to have oily skin (I'm more combination skin) but the ingredients salicylic acid and glycolic acid are great for sloughing off dead skin cells and removing dirt and excess sebum. While I wasn't miracles, as I've dealt with somewhat cystic acne for years, it has really improved my skin by shrinking my pores like it says it does, providing that extra deep clean without damaging the skin, and seems to be speeding up the healing process of previous blemishes/pimples. I also follow-up with a glycolic acid night cream. When using glycolic acid products, sunscreen is a must since glycolic acid acts in the same way as a facial scrub or mild facial peel. I also really love the tingling feeling after applying it, as it gives me a deep clean feeling without being too stripping of natural oils. Bonus is that it's under Sephora's 'Clean Beauty' products. Love that too. As you can tell, I am loving this product and it's been a game changer for me. I've been quite satisfied using other Olehenriksen products as well and this experience definitely gives me more confidence in trying out other products from this line.

I like when you exfoliate, and feel a sensation like you actually did something. It tingles and my face goes red for a little while and then feels the softest it has ever been. I cannot get these results with anything else. Mary Kay exfoliation comes close to it minus the ingredients you get in this. The price is what I cannot get past. I got mine in a subscription box.

It’s not a sickeningly sweet smell either. It literally smells like you just cut into an orange. It’s the perfect balance of zest and sweetness (can you tell I’m totally into citrus smells? Lol) it does not have a chemical cleanser scent. It just feels so refreshing every morning! This does not strip your skin so you don’t get that squeaky clean feeling like you can get with other cleansers. I have hormonal acne prone skin plus obnoxious eczema so lots of things (especially things with fragrance) tend to irritate my skin. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has not flared or irritated my eczema and has not broken me out. While I know the fragrance is probably not the best for my skin, it just smells sooooo good! It’s just a cleanser and I wash it off quickly so as long as my skin isn’t reacting, I’m okay with it!

I always use a makeup wipe to get the majority of my makeup off and use a cleanser afterwards. Unless I do a cleansing balm and hot towel in between, I will almost always get some makeup off when I use a toner with a cotton pad. With this cleanser, that doesn’t happen. Additionally, the scent is so juicy and pleasant. It’s citrusy and refreshing. At this fair price, I’ll be sure to stock up on this to always have it by the sink and the shower. A+!

That and the YTTP cleanser would leak out of the pump whenever I tried to use a half-pump for morning cleanses. In any case, while YTTP is great, this Olehenriksen Truth Juice is LOVELY. It smells amazing, the squeeze bottle delivery means I can better control how much I use (which is a little smaller than a dime size), my skin appears to have brightened, and my texture has improved. On top of that, it removes every trace of makeup at the end of the day without a double cleanse. 10/10 would recommend, especially for my oily folks.

I used the Oil Control cleanser by Ole Henriksen before switching to this one and it worked well before on my skin. But now it’s making me feel a little dry considering that winter is still ending and the temperatures are slightly cold. I’ve only been using this for 5 days in a row now and I can already see good changes. My skin looks so much brighter and radiant, and the very tiny bit of acne I had on my right cheek is starting to diminish. This has been working amazing along with my other skincare products (serum, oil, etc). And I enjoy the scent, it smells like an orange candy. I take it my skin is not so sensitive since the fragrance has had no negative effect, but that may be something to consider for extremely sensitive skin!! My face feels more hydrated now, perhaps during summer I will go back to my oil control cleanser :)

Second, I don’t care for the smell at all. I also felt as though I was using more of this product per use and I went through the whole container faster than I have with the previous two brands mentioned. I suggest spending your money on Farmacy’s balm...it’s the same price, but works so much better.

An added bonus is this is refreshing and smells so good. I also love the packaging. A huge pet peeve is when I put bottles in my bag and the top comes off ( especially when the bottles are spray bottles). The top stays on so well and is a pleasure for travel use.

If you read the ingredients you can see that not only does it have alcohol (doesn’t matter that it’s naturally derived, that is a super drying ingredient), it’s all things that you can access easily and thus this toner is easily dupe-able vía DIY. It’s just water, alcohol, and essential oils like rosemary and mint. By the way, the rosemary and mint can be really astringent and harsh, especially when you get to the end of the bottle (which wastes a lot of product). I also don’t like the packaging - the glass bottle is really heavy and the lid/sprayer are a weird material that feels really cheap. Please just make this yourself. Can’t believe this is $49!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"After being introduced to a soothing mist that my esthetic nurse friend gave me a sample of, I wrestled within myself on whether or not I should incorporate something like that in my skincare routine. Also, I remember years ago that an esthetician I knew years ago would use one of Dermalogica's additives (I think it was the Clearing Additive) in my treatments and I loved it. Before using the soothing mist, I wouldn't even give any consideration about buying something like this as I would have deemed it as unnecessary. Also, the Dermalogica Additive provided one of the best experiences I've had during a facial (other than the pops, of course). So, after using mostly fragrance-free or no-added fragrance products in my skincare routine (as well as my husband complaining that some of the products did have an aversive scent. I don't blame him as I felt the same way), I found myself missing that sensory element of smelling spa-like aromas. Also, I consider my skincare routine to be a slice of time that I have for myself. Ultimately, I bought a bottle of this stuff as it turned out to be gentle on my skin (I made sure to test it out first by spritzing it each time I went to a Sephora), which is great because it does list ""parfum"" as part of its ingredients. Also, the sprayer produces very fine mists that feels like a true moisture boost (kind of like a light humidifier feeling) as opposed to a feeling like small drops landed on my skin & falling down on my face like tears. I don't find myself fanning my face after using this. The elements of a great spray mechanism, soothing to my face, & the spa-like sensory experience are the top reasons why I decided to buy this. The fact that it can be easily purchased at popular store like Sephora is an added bonus. Is this product ""extra""? Perhaps. However, I do find the sensory experiences of things, especially something I do every single day, important as it does give me a sense of calm, as well as provide nice added moisture.

The 125ml lasted me one month, but I use it every night - it’s difficult to dose the right quantity and you might endup wasting a good amount of it if you’re not careful. I would’ve loved a better dispensing system.

As I was using those, I noticed I have to rub my eyes excessively to remove my washable mascara, which damaged my eyelashes. I was looking for smth better, that would remove efortlessly my makeup. I did my research and saw Clinique makeup remover being so popular here, having tons of amazing reviews, including those that said it's much better than bi-facil, I was also very pleased with the price, so I decided to buy biggest size and was waiting for my product with excitement. Now I want to explain very detailed what is the difference between bifacil (bf) and clinique (cl), when you look at both bottles they seem to have relatively same amount of liquid and oil, but ones you use cotton pad with cl and start using it on your eyes, you notice only oil, no liquid, you have to rub same amount of time like with bf, but it's super oily, greasy, gets into your eyes and irritates them, mascara does not just melt on the pad like with bf, but flakes and those flakes dragg everywhere on your face, so you need either a makeup removing wipe or another cotton pad with a more liquid product to remove all that mess. Bf feels more liquidy, not too oily, does not get into your eyes and melts mascara in a way that it transfers to the pad in a clean way. I only need to use one pad with bf eyes and 1 bf for face, with cl I need much more pads and more work and the whole process is messy and oily. Now I am left with jumbo size of this product that I have to use somehow, as I don't like to waste or return stuff, but I learned my lesson, I will never buy a makeup remover without trying a sampler. What I found to be removing mascara easier and gentlier is Tatcha camelia cleansing oil and if any of you guys will find a double phase makeup remover that really works, please dm me.

The tube makes for easy and clean dispensing. Mine came in a kit with the anti wrinkle serum and exfoliator. I stopped using my Fresh products a few days ago to try Kate and I feel like the cleanser is drying my skin out and I had some breakouts and it doesn’t seem to do anything for them. I’m only on day 4 of using it. but my skin doesn’t look nearly as hydrated as when I was using some of the Fresh products. I only tried the exfoliator on the first day so I don’t think that is the issue. I already have dry/combination skin and live in Southern California and the weather is getting colder so maybe just isn’t meant for my skin type in this climate at the moment. I really wanted to like this one because the ingredients are very good for the skin.

The smell is fresh and sweet. The formula is dreamy. It's soft, it's foamy, and just perfect. I've never had a problem with dryness or that tightness that sometimes comes after cleansing. It doesn't make my skin feel oily, either. It's just great. I could rave on about this for a long time, but I urge anyone here to try it. The exfoliating features are subtle, but I do notice a difference in my skin since using this. Kate Somerville, I love you.

I have this toner and then a strong toner for other purposes. The petals do get on your cotton pad, but they don't ever end up on my face. They stick to the pad, so I wouldn't let that deter you.

It's mild but effectively cleans my face, and it's just so refreshing to have an alcohol-free toner that feels good on the face. When I use regular toners, the alcohol often removes too much grease from my face and makes the dry/oily parts worse. This one does everything just perfectly, not to mention it smells great!! It's a mild, tea-like scent that makes me feel better every time I use it. I'm on my second bottle.

I thought it was a hormonal breakout leading up to my period, so I continued to use this toner. The bumps got worse and I switched back to my regular toner (Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, which I'm not in love with since it dries my skin out despite clearing out my acne) for about a week and the bumps went away. After my period, I tried out the REN toner again to see if I'd break out, putting it on in the morning. Later that evening, I noticed the small forehead pimples came back. I will likely exchange what's left of the product for another toner that is more gentle on my skin.

I was under the impression that this toner is gentle enough to use daily, but if you use a vitamin C serum in the AM and chemical exfoliants or retinol products in the PM, then you are really not supposed to combine this toner with those exfoliants. I didn't realize that in the beginning and ended up with a very irritated chin!! after much research, and speaking with someone at Ren, I discovered vitamin C and acid toners shouldn't be combined. The company should do a better job explaining that to us. It's not a big deal but it's somewhat a bummer as I was hoping this toner could be used every morning. But I'll have to get another gentle toner for daily use and use this once or twice a week only when I skip on the vitamin C.

If your skin really likes Good Genes from Sunday Riley, it will probably like this as both are mainly lactic acid. For my skin, it’s far superior to the pixi glow tonic, the Ole Henrikson dark spot toner (in the blue bottle), or the first aid beauty radiance pads. Also why would anyone buy the 250 ml when the 500 ml is an extra $9? It’s DOUBLE THE PRODUCT!

I love the well-pump it has for application, you just place a cotton pad over it and press down, usually one to two pumps is enough for me. I have been using this every morning and night for 3 weeks and the bottle is still more than three quarters full. It does not have a fragrance as listed under the Ren Clean Skincare label along with other things it does not have. It offers very gentle exfoliation on my dry/combination aging skin and even completely got rid of some tiny flesh colored bumps I was starting to get under my eyes, which surprisingly did not irritate the surrounding eye area. My skin does feel a little bit sticky after application, but nothing too bothersome. It really gets rid of any remaining dirt and dead skin cells after washing my face. I have also noticed an actual glow with continued use of this product. I have a lot of little dark hyperpigmentation spots from a deep laser resurfacing treatment I had a year ago and am trying out everything to see what works on them. I think this does make my skin more even toned, but I’m also currently using Korres wild rose Vitamin C oil and their moisturizers that claim to lighten dark spots. Either way, I will continue to buy this toner as I find it does not dry out my skin like other toners I have tried before and it makes my skin feel nice and look healthier.

I carry it in my purse and spray it directly on my face, usually in the middle of the day when I can feel my skin getting tired and stressed out. It definitely soothes my stressed out skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and looking slightly dewy. My only problem is that the smell is somewhat off-putting. It just smells like baby lotion. It goes away after a while though, so it's not a big deal. In my opinion, this is a little pricey for a toner, but it is also marketed as like a toner essence deal. If you have oily skin like me, this may be worth the price as I think it definitely does help balance my skin.

I bought the brightening one instead of the purifying one because it was suggested to me by one of the girls there and because they don’t sell the purifying one in store at my local Sephora, but I’m glad I did. It’s helped to brighten my skin and lighten my old acne scars. I’ve repurchased this 3 times already and have been using it for about a year and a half with my Clarisonic and I can’t imagine using any other cleanser. I feel like you do get your money’s worth since one pump is more than enough for your whole face. I also love using it as a mask, I usually just leave it on my skin for a few minutes before I rinse off and I’m done! I’ve definitely found my HG cleanser in this one. Btw, summer or winter this cleanser will leave your skin feeling clean without feeling tight or like there’s a residue.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"I've read the negative reviews on this face wash and feel some clarification is needed. This face wash is not a one-stop shop for acne and oil control. In my opinion, full control of either of those in a face wash for us combo/oily gals simply isn't possible; diet, additional skincare regimen items (the right toner, serums, chemical exfoliants), and mattifying primer and foundation are truly the only ways to keep a lid on them. What it IS is a cleanser that's balanced and leaves skin clean and moisturized without stripping it (thus leading your sebum glands to overproduce oil to make up for what was taken, aka shine more zits). Everyone's skin is different. For me personally, with regular use this face wash keeps my acne at bay (minus occasional pimples due to my food choices and/or stress levels). I've also run out of moisturizer and had to use this face wash solo (I know, massive no-no), but post-wash my face has never once felt tight or dried out. That, combined with the face that even as a SUPER oily gal I only need a *literal* pea-size amount of it to properly lather and clean my skin makes it 10/10 for me.

There are other ingredients in there as well that worsen fungal acne. I made the mistake of buying this on a whim without checking the ingredients and I started to breakout again after a couple uses. The idea of oil control is cute but this product seems to do more drying than balancing. This is probably the last time I buy from Ole Henriksen as the brand doesn’t seem to understand the importance of pH and often uses comedogenic ingredients. Cute aesthetic tho.

Also with the lid shut it seems to be leaking from the bottle into the lid and actually seemed like it’s half empty.

My skin is very reactive, so I really took my time working up to using it daily, and I experienced no breakouts or issues. Like other reviewers, my only issue with it is that it does leave your face sticky (it even smells like syrup imo), and yes even when you do follow up with a moisturizer and even if you do use a small amount. That being said, I don't think that's a reason to not get it, but if you sleep with a silk pillowcase, it is a bit uncomfortable since your face will straight up stick to it.

Yes it will be tacky, but if you watched the video's and use as instructed, you should be following with a moisturizer or oil. You should never leave off at just toner anyways, everyone needs to moisturize. Otherwise, this toner is amazing. Usually other toners dry me out and are really harsh, but I can really feel this one taking away my dead skin cells and refining my skin WITHOUT leaving my skin extra tight and dry. My skin texture is SMOOOOTH and so plump, which I never ever thought would happen considering how dry I am, which means I'm prone to more wrinkles. My pimples also gradually go away with it, which is good because it prevents the urge to pop them lol. Overall, best toner ever.

This will make your skin purge and that means you WILL breakout. But, if you use it enough in the next few weeks your skin will get better. The AHA in this product is meant to shed your dead skin cells and produce new ones which means it will bring all the gunk underneath that you might not be able to see, to the surface. I used this product and it only made me breakout in my problem areas (which means it’s purging and not breaking me out) so I continued to use it. My skin got way better and now I don’t have any acne.

It leaves a film on your skin and you cannot apply a serum, emulsion or cream on top or else itll look and feel like a goopy sticky film. Toners should prep your skin for the next steps of your routine (to make them even more effective) and while this product isnt cheap and probably very powerful, its a shame that you cant layer your other powerful products right on top. Also, there is an off white creamy film that grows inside the bottle cap and top of the product (granted, it sits stagnant as I dont use often) but its gross and I dont like to have to clean it. Since I have the product, Ill use it up. I use it when im really lazy and dont feel like doing several steps of a night routine. The sticky film it leaves feels slightly moisturizing so its not uncomfortable to skip cream. If you have really dry skin I would avoid this product. Possibly would be ok for very very oily skin As far as it doing what it says...I didnt notice anything spectacular when I did use it regularly ... bottom line - wouldnt purchase again

I use it 1-2 times a week on a cotton pad. I love how it evens out my skin and helps fade my post acne scarring without irritating my skin or giving me redness- it tingles a bit upon application but that faded pretty quickly. However, it leaves a very sticky film on your skin as it dries so I’m giving this 4 stars. The stickiness does go away after a while, but I’d rather just not have that feeling at all.

Skin Type Combination",3 stars,"**This review is for the MINI packs of the coconut and watermelon cleansing wipes ($3 a pack with 10 wipes per pack)** For reference, I’ve tried the regular $8 wipes (25 ct) in some of the other scents/formulations and really enjoyed them. These mini packs, however, were a big miss for me. First, the packs are TINY. This wouldn’t be a problem (they’re definitely cute) if the wipes inside weren’t also MINUSCULE! I thought the only difference was the number of wipes included but they are actually less than half the size of the regular ones. Second, they aren’t nearly as saturated as the normal-sized packs. I ordered both the coconut and watermelon minis and they arrived completely sealed but were still relatively dry. It helped to wet them with water first but that kind of defeats the purpose especially if you want to use them while on the go. As for the specific scent/benefit, I won’t be purchasing the coconut or the watermelon in the regular size. The coconut didn’t have enough of a scent to it and the watermelon smelled too artificial for my tastes. Performance wise, neither was anything special. Specifically, as cleansing wipes they were just average (when wetted). Removed light makeup ok but I still felt the need to wash my face afterwards. When used just to cleanse/refresh (again, after wetting) they left some residue that I guess was hydrating but I didn’t love the feel of it so I washed it off. Overall, the minis just aren’t worth it. If you think you will enjoy the scent of the coconut or watermelon and want a basic, nonirritating facial wipe, go for the regular sizes.

You may need to double cleanse after using these make up wipes. I found removing eye make up was a challenge. I like all my eye make up removed with no residue. This product did not remove all my eye makeup. I had raccoon eyes after cleansing the eye make up off. They are great for traveling. They were moist when I received them. That's good. This product is not in my loves basket. Depends what on you want for a product to do. Extra cleansing no go here!

I don't wear makeup, so I can't speak to how well it works with makeup removal, but it does clear pores very respectfully when used with one of those cheap, silicone face scrubbies. It gets 4 stars only because it doesn't do much else in the way of improving skin. It doesn't even out my tone or clear acne or reduce pores, but it didn't make anything worse or cause any reactions and for me that's enough for a win. I found this to be a great day-to-day cleanser and it doesn't interact poorly with any toners or treatments or serums, so it's been great as an anchor product when I'm trying out new items in my regiment. Would absolutely recommend if you need something that will consistently work and won't give you any hassle.

Finally I have a routine that seems to be working really well for the past year. On most days I double cleanse with an oil and then the Kiehl’s. When I don’t wear eye make up this is all I use for the face. But typically I wear a little concealer under the eyes/where the pimples du jour are, eyeliner, and blush. It’s not a lot of make up but I still love melting it off at the end of the day with an oil. Right now I’m using the Tata Harper Nourishing Oil Cleanser but was using coconut oil before. I rinse that off with water, and follow with the Kiehl’s and it feels like a nice balance. Be mindful of how much you use. A little goes a LONG way. At first I think I was using too much and it started to feel a bit drying. Love the gel to foam action! Oh, it will last you forever.

My skin felt so clean and smooth, without the irritation that most exfoliating cleansers leave me with. The scent is great and the packaging is gorgeous. Sadly it’s not cruelty-free and as a pet momma of four fur babies, I can’t bring myself to buy it. But if you’re not concerned about cruelty-free products, I would recommend it.

When I first try a cleanser I always want to make sure this takes off all my makeup - which it does, even my mascara. I like how gentle it is and doesn't strip my face. I am also BIG on the ingredients and I love that this cleanser is paraben free, fragrance free, and has Potent antioxidant - vitamin C, which protects against free radical damage.One of the ingredients that I saw and was not sure about is alcohol because I didn't want it to dry out my face, however it is the last ingredient which means there is a very small percentage of it and I didn't see a problem with it. So after giving this cleanser a fair chance, I do like it and recommend to give it a try if you are looking for a clean cleanser. I also love the smell - it is very refreshing.

It feels nice and smooth on my skin, but for me it did not suds much. Sudsing or lack of doesn’t mean that the product is any less effective, I just love to see and feel the suds (mental thing) as it makes me feel like more is happening. I own several low or no sud cleansers and they work wonderfully, so this isn’t an exception. I applied it both on dry skin, as recommended on the bottle, and my standard technique of applying it to an already wet face. Still no change in how suds up. However, I prefer my technique. It does feel refreshing and calming on my skin and that is always a plus. Two weeks isn’t enough time for me to detail any significant positive changes in my skin, but it is more than enough for me to say I haven’t had any negative reactions or results using this product.

I’ve been using this stuff morning and night for about 6 months now and I’m still on my first bottle. It’s one of my favorite parts of my routine. I have been using a prescription strength adepalene gel (differin) for acne for about three months now. For anyone that has ever tried it knows that although it’s a miracle product, it dries your skin out SOOOOO BAD for a few weeks. This FAB wild oat toner was my saving grace. It keeps your skin soft and moisturized and prepares it so well for the next step in your routine. I am going to buy this forever!

So I went some having oily akin to combination and found anything harsh (or really anything moderately drying) just made my break out like crazy. Same goes for anything super hydrating. I’ve been washing my face with just a bar of soap so it cleans but still preserves my own natural oils. Well now I’m 32 and have started noticing some akin differences and freaked out and ordered some products on Sephora based on reviews. This. Is. Amazing. My skin feels like silk- my blackheads have visibly decreased and of course it smells fantastic too. I love the consistency- I think of toner as something that strips my skin and this most certainly does not. I had a little makeup on my skin yesterday (I rarely use any because I like it to breathe- maybe why it’s taken so long to see any aging though!) and I thought I got it all off with my new face wash but then I used the toner and was amazed at the color on my cotton ball. I decided to write a review because my skin is glowing this morning when I woke up. This product (and a few liters of water a day) are plumping up my akin so wonderfully. Definitely a buy and a staple in your routine.

Whether I’m using my hands or a cleansing brush, afterwards my skin is left smooth and all the dry skin is gone. I used Tatcha’s exfoliating cleanser before this, and now I can never go back. My skin has improved so much since I’ve used this product. My foundation no longer clings to dry skin on my face because this cleanser takes it all away! The smell is natural and fantastic.

I like my cleansers to not give a “squeaky” clean tight feeling but I don’t like it when I feel an “oily” residue either, I could def tell there’s olive oil in this formula bc it feels like I have the leftover residue. It’s not severe and if you use a toner afterwards it’s not a big deal. As for the efficacy, I don’t think I saw any? It’s certainly not a miracle changing product, it’s pretty much a mild salicylic acid wash with micro exfoliants and a little bit of olive oil for moisture...

For some reason, this toner is soothing, placating my fussy skin like no other. Recently, I tried to branch out into 7 skins territory, sampling all kinds of eastern and western potions only to come running back to this one, head hung down. I don't feel like I should have to spend so much on a liquid and will literally cry watching my paycheck sprinkle out onto a cotton pad. The essence is fancy water, but this is sorcery. Acids are so far down the list that I don't expect exfoliation and if I wanted a burn, I will grab some P50. This is just normalizing water for my skin which in some regard, is priceless...but don't tell my boyfriend what I just spent on toner, both concepts are shocking to him.

I used it for somewhere around 1-2 months, once or twice a day to give it a fair chance before reviewing. Pros: it really does seem to pull out any leftover makeup that’s still on your face after washing. Cons: dries out skin at times, runs out quickly, causes breakouts, and actually made my skin uneven at times (probably because it dried out certain areas of my face) Also, I saw a ton of other reviewers saying that this toner doesn’t contain alcohol or water, but beware it actually contains both! I’m glad that this seems to work for other people’s skin, but not mine. For reference: I have combination skin (oily in t-zone, normal everywhere else). overall this toner is absolutely not anything special and doesn’t last long and therefore not worth the $50 price. I am also attaching a photo of the ingredient list to this review.

Back then, I thought that toners with alcohol were the most effective in getting rid of acne. I was wrong. This toner balances the pH level of the skin and I think that helps in improving skin clarity. It’s a little expensive for a toner, but it does last for a long time.

What I didn’t like: Before using this toner I was using the ORIGINS mega mushroom toner which contains 6.7 fl. oz for $35.00 (this toner was great, it had an earthy smell to it and also helped with redness and hydration) but I decided to try Amorepacific since I heard really good things about it but the thing that disappointed me was that the bottle tricked me, it was very huge and thought “wow $50 for a lot of product not bad” but then I found out it was only 3.4 fl.oz they really like to trick ppl with bottle sizes/packaging :( I bought this product on July 25th and i am running out already and it’s August 21 * I use this product day and night. Overall I would recommend this item since I did see results and enjoyed it! Just the amount of product you get makes me a bit upset I would of done a comparison of the origins bottle but I threw it away already.

After several years of dealing with adult acne I finally realized that I had been treating it the wrong way. I came to a realization that I had dry acne prone skin after believing for a long time that I had oily/combination. The strong AHAs and high pH cleansers I had been using were irritating my dry skin and causing me to constantly break out with pustules. I change my cleanser to an hydrating one, switched to this Amorepacific treatment toner, layered it with vitamin C, the ordinary niacinamide and moisturizer. My skin has never been better! Being African, I got lots of dark spots from my previous skincare routine but now I only have a few left. I only break out during that time of the month. I am currently looking out for an alternative as this runs out very quickly, I am now on my second bottle.

I tried it and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't drying at all. Actually it's very hydrating and gentle. Plus, I love the added natural AHA to help with dullness.

I’m not a hype person, I never buy into hype and I always do hours and hours of research and testing before buying something especially when it’s expensive. I used this La Mer Cleaning Foam for one year and absolutely love it. It’s the best cleanser I ever used, period. I have dry skin and this always made my skin feel cleansed without tightening/drying it up and is super gentle for my really sensitive skin that has a mind of its own. I was trying to find a cheaper alternative after I am almost out of this one so I tested a few cleaners. I immediately went back online and bought this again after some disaster situations with other cleaners where I face felt like it was on fire and all red and I realized this is still THE BEST! Sticking to this and I’ve been using one bottle for close to a year now, nuts! So in actuality, it’s not that expensive, also, because it’s priced higher than most others you will be more conscious of not wasting or overusing it which means less plastic waste buying more.

BUT, even for a travel/sample/small size whatever you want to call this 1oz, it’s expensive! $25 for this tiny bottle! It’s SUPER small so beware. I couldn’t get over how small the tube was, and the cleanser itself is not a miracle or holy grail cleanser, therefore I couldn’t see myself paying $95 for the larger/full size. The cleanser however, did cleanse my skin good without leaving it tight, stripped or dry. It actually left my skin smooth and feeling hydrated. The scent didn’t smell luxurious or anything but it wasn’t bad. It’s like a fresh, light, green Irish spring soap kind of smell, and I expected more from La Mer as far as that. It did have a great lather/foam to it, and a little bit goes a long way. Good enough for me not to return this, but I won’t repurchase it and can’t say I will recommend this over something else first.

Let’s start with the size, for the price you get an enormous amount of product that will last you months. It’s an exfoliating cleanser, it has AHA/BHA To chemically exfoliate your skin but also tiny little micro beads that physically exfoliate as well. But super tiny and in no way abrasive. It makes my skin beautiful for makeup. I was using it everyday but recently cut down to 4 days a week when I am using a chemical exfoliate in a serum or toner. But this is just a must have, I’ve tried so many cleansers and this one beats them by far!

I feel like it’s aging my skin, as the alcohol in it just zaps any life out of it (and I have very oily skin). While it cleans it the gunk, it isn’t necessary. I find that If i actually double cleanse and properly remove my makeup I don’t need a toner to do the job. It’s just extra money wasted on a step that could’ve been done with an effective cleanser. But if you really need a toner and love the exfoliation, I’d recommend finding one that doesn’t have alcohol in it. You might think it’ll work fabulously with oily skin, but it’s honestly just plain drying. Will not be repurchasing, and if I do decide to bother with toners again in the future, I’ll be sure to find one that doesn’t include alcohol.

I bought it during the next sale and have been using it ever since. If you think it's not working then I'd suggest using a little more and letting is soak on a cotton pad first and holding in on your eyes for a few seconds so that the cleanser can penetrate through all the layers of makeup and do not rub or tug at the eye area! We don't want wrinkles so be gentle and just let it sit and do the work for you so that you don't have to go over the same area a bunch of times. Would not suggest going straight in on your eyes without a cotton pad (also works really, really well on a makeup eraser). Would suggest shaking it before each use as I've found it does settle a little bit if it hasn't been used in a while. Would definitely recommend if you wear a lot of heavy and/or waterproof eye makeup. I wouldn't call it a sensitive eye cleanser, I have sensitive eyes and sometimes it does sting but it works so I'll deal with it as it's nothing unbearable and the sting goes away quickly.

I have always liked using an acne/ oil control face wash in the AM but my current one contained salicylic acid which is not safe to use during pregnancy. I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product. Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used! I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my t-zone while not over drying the rest of my face. I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily t-zone but normal-dry cheeks. I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer. It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient? The smell doesn’t linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face. I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away. This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again, it is just so good!

This has been the holy grail product that has kept our acne at bay. I love how creamy it goes against the skin. A little goes a long way because of the rich lather and the tube lasts a long time. Even when you can't squeeze anymore out, cut it open and there's about a week's left use in there. I also love how my face doesn't feel tight after washing. Wonderful, wonderful face wash and does all it claims. Definitely will be using this for many more years to come!

While searching, I came across this product and based on the reviews, I took a chance and decided to buy the full size. I was wowed by the initial result at how bright my skin was.I didn't realise how amazing this product was until recently however. My skin began to freakout about 2 months ago, as result of facial threading. Nothing was helping and the breakouts were getting worse. Initially, I stayed away from this product, because I thought anything that exfoliates would be too harsh for my sensitive skin given the breakouts, turns out I was wrong! I started using the powder again, because I traveled and it was the only wash I had at the time. I used it consistently for 4 days and to my pleasant surprise, the breakouts started to subside. Almost 7 days later and the breakouts have almost completely disappeared! All I can say is WOW!!! This stuff is amazing! I am so grateful I had it in my arsenal of skincare when I needed it! I'll definitely be repurchasing and also now using as my daily cleanser.

It is easy to use and gentle on the skin but yet still so effective. This has helped keep my skin radiant and glowing and helped to remove dark spots from acne. Note that it looks very similar to the tatcha powder cleanser but works very differently. This works more like a chemical exfoliator rather than a physical one and is much more effective in my opinion. I use a little less than the packaging automatically dispenses. Great product.

I found the previous design allowed for clumps to form and get lodged in. I ended up prying it open one day (after trying for at least half an hour) to get the rest of the product out due to the clumps that formed blocking the opening.

I also find that after just using it once my skin looks so much brighter and it has decreased the size of my pores. My acne scars have slowly been disappearing with the use of this product in the last 2 months. I have also received so many compliments on how my skin looks so much nicer lately. This product is expensive but it lasts as I still have more than half a bottle and I have been using this product at least once a day the past 2 months.

This product is a mechanical exfoliator with a tone of gritty particles in it. Wet your hands, squeeze out a dollop and rub in circular motions all over your face (and chest if you’d like). It doesn’t feel harsh, doesn’t leave my skin looking beaten up, isn’t greasy or oily and actually takes care of all of the annoying little flakes that appear on my face especially in the winter. Packaging is great too. It’s easy to stand it up on its cap and I love knowing that I’ve use up every last speck of it before purchasing another tube. Bonus: use it as a lip exfoliant for a smooth, plump pout. Safe enough to use twice a day or every day if you need it. Otherwise, a couple times a week is sufficient. You won’t regret this purchase!

I have pretty normal skin, with some hyperpigmentation spots. Those spots have started to fade some. But again, it’s $75! I definitely don’t think this product is worth paying that. Maybe $35, definitely not $75. I think if you find a scrub with a good grain, you may get the same benefits. While this grain feels small, it’s abrasive, and exfoliates well. But it’s not performing any miracles.

BUT this dries out my skin like crazyyy. My makeup will sit on my face in dry patches for a few days after I'm finished using this... And that's coming from a girl with an oil slick face normally. I will continue to use this for my breakouts until I find something better, but beware of the dry skin aftermath.

I normally just stick to a gentle hydrating cleanser because I have dry skin. I also have relatively sensitive skin, and at first when I would use this cleanser, it would make my skin red and tingly feeling, and my skin had to work up a tolerance to using this product. But once I was able to use this product without it making my skin dry, red and sensitive, it has worked amazingly well at clearing up any blemishes I tend to get. I don’t recommend this product if you have extremely sensitive skin, because it could be a little too harsh.

This is very gentle, a nice thick balm that almost liquefies on contact with the skin. It does emulsify but I use it as recommended with the muslin cloth to wipe it off. If I use just the cleansing balm by itself my skin feels a bit dry afterwards. I always follow up with my Clarisonic and a water-based cleanser afterwards anyways so for me it’s not a problem. I enjoy the smell very much, it smells very natural, herbal, and spa like to me. This does a good job removing my long lasting sunblock. I would recommend this for people who do wear a lot of make up and are looking for a gentle balm cleanser following up with a water-based cleanser afterwards. I would also recommend this to people who don’t wear make up to be used alone as a nourishing facial cleanser. I am extremely acne prone and this has not broken me out or clogged my pores. The most important thing to me about this is that it doesn’t bother my sensitive eyes.

I pair it with the SK-II lotion or essence and then the Tatcha water cream and my skin is kept at bay from flare ups and angry redness and breakouts for the most part. The muslin is really key too as I was attempting to create a shortcut by skipping that step but honestly it was a waste of my time. The muslin makes this both a regular cleanser and a light exfoliant but not irritating to anyone with sensitive concerns. I find I like the kind of herby/grassy smell, it works when you follow the instructions and create a little mini facial thing there with the pressure points and whatever. Anyway, it works and I stock up during the big sales so I am never without it! The small containers are great for travel as they done leak or anything.

When I spend money on high end products I expect them to be amazing, not mediocre. Unfortunately, this cleanser is mediocre. It is gentle and feels nice on the skin. I didn’t experience and break outs or negative reactions using this. If you are sensitive to scents or don’t like using skincare products that have a scent, this isn’t for you. My complaint is that it doesn’t remove all my makeup. It doesn’t remove eyeliner or mascara completely and I’ve used other cleansers that do the job. I double cleanse, of course, but I do have high expectations when using cleansing balms. The ingredients in this aren’t luxurious to me and not worth the high price tag. I am in love with the Drunk Elephant cleanser. Those ingredients are better, no scent, removes all my makeup, cheaper, and cruelty free. Eve Lom’s cleanser was a no from me and I don’t think I would try any of their other products in the future.

First of all, it seems so freaking good and you don´t even need to use a lot of it so the mini is lasting me a long time. And maybe this is because the only other exfoliator I have ever used is that Kate Somerville one but years ago so I don´t know that much about them, but I saw the difference right away, like no kidding. Before I even washed it off, my face looked so much brighter and glowy, it's crazy. And afterward, my entire face was so incredibly smooth that I couldn't stop feeling my face. And I don't know but my face just looks so much better and like new and fresh. So you definitely definitelyyyy need to try this one out, especially if you´re new to exfoliators.

I would have thought by now my skin would have adapted to the products and there’d be a plateau of some sort, but that hasn’t happened.

After Sephora stopped carrying my previous wash, a clerk sheepishly suggested this and I was so embarrassed/angry/in-a-hurry that I overspent on this... or so I thought. I have now tried several other face washes, a couple that are even more expensive, but I have found the best results for me with some gentle exfoliation combined with the PTR cleanser. I am less oily for longer. I break out usually after skipping this for too long. I can feel 'tight' with this but, if used in rotation, I find it to be pleasant and youthful rather than drying.

It doesn’t strip my face or leave it tight feeling but I do have to moisturize afterwards. But my skin has become poreless. I even am seeing my fine lines less. This product works for me. Be careful because it does have acids that will strip your face and one could end up over exfoliating. I don’t use any other exfoliating product because it’s too harsh for my skin.

But I thought I’d try this with the thought of using it in the morning when I just want a light non stripping cleanser and/or after steaming my face. I feel like although this is lightweight and a clean product- I feel like I needed more than a usual amount (dime size) to really reach my whole face and enough to feel like I’m able wash it away. It doesn’t run or warm up- it sits like a gel cream. So in my opinion, I prefer to keep using either Caudalie Foaming Cleanser, YTP Green Cleanser, and Korres Greek Yoghurt Cleanser. They’re clean, lather, are gentle, moisture balancing, non stripping and I always feel like my face is fully clean afterwards. I imagine this is a great product for someone with very oily skin, ultra-ultra sensitive skin or even for a younger teen starting out a skin care regimen.

My sister used it while we were on vacation and loved it. My mom uses Vaseline to remove her eye makeup, so I’m giving her this as a gentle nudge to please stop. This is thick and removes waterproof mascara really well on its own, but is absolutely amazing when combined with a makeup remover cloth. As with all makeup removers, they are not meant to actually cleanse your skin, only remove that top layer of makeup. If this is your only product, then of course you will have an oil residue left behind. Double cleansing is something almost everyone should be doing. First, remove makeup with makeup remover. Second, use an actual cleanser to cleanse your skin. When used this way, I never have residue left behind.

I like the simplicity of this makeup remover. It really does a great job at breaking down makeup. I also love that it includes a little spatula to use. My only con & the reasoning behind 4 stars vs 5 is that it does leave a film- like feeling on the skin BUT once you cleanse it comes right off. The Clinique one doesn’t cause that. Overall, I would recommend. Works just as well as the high-end makeup remover balms.

The smell is not bad and it doesn’t sting my eyes. It starts real waxy-like but warming it on my fingertips helps before working it into my face. After a couple of minutes of massaging it on my face, I add a little bit of water until I feel the texture change everywhere to an oil and massage a few seconds more. After that, it rinses off pretty easily. I think the price is good for the amount of product you get. 4 stars only because my other product melts on contact = less tugging of skin, but warming it beforehand helped a lot.

Skin Type Combination",3 stars,"I’ve been using this cleanser from the SK-II travel-size set for the past week, and it is a good basic cleanser. I’ve never been able to get it to foam like the model does in the demonstration video, but it does lather enough to serve its purpose and cleanse the skin. The scent is a very light soapy smell, which is nice. And once the cleanser is washed away, skin feels clean and not over dried. However, this cleanser is not very well suited for my breakout-prone skin because I need something either with more texture to scrub the skin, or stronger acne-targeting ingredients to reduce my breakouts. I’ve reduced a star on this rating because it doesn’t do a good job of addressing my breakouts, and reduced another star because of the high price for such a basic cleanser. I’m a huge fan of SK-II products, but don’t think the price is quite justified on this particular one. This cleanser would be well-suited for someone primarily focused on maintaining clean skin, without any major skin concerns. I, on the other hand, will probably use this sample until it’s all gone and then go back to the cleanser I used before. I’ll update this review if my opinion changes once the entire sample is used up.

I used to only use this at on long days that I was wearing heavy makeup (because it's so pricey!) but after seeing the beautiful results, I've began using it day and night and my skin has never looked better. This cleanses so well without leaving my skin squeaky and uncomfortably clean/dry feeling. I apply it with dry hands on a dry face and massage it into the skin, then rinse off with warm water. It then lathers to a soft foam, and it smells clean and minty. If I need a really deep clean, I will use a facial brush as I'm rinsing with water. This cleanser balances my skin, leaving it refreshed and bright, and free of texture, especially when I use my facial brush (about once or twice a week). Using one pump twice a day doesn't stretch the product very long in my opinion which is kind of disappointing considering the price but I cannot be without this cleanser and I would recommend it to any normal or oily-skinned person who is looking to combat acne, blemishes, or texture.

It actually leaves your skin moisturizer rather than drying you out, like most other acne cleansers. I use it morning and night, massaging about 1-2 pumps onto my skin, and will leave it on for 5-10 minutes, as I finish getting ready, which I think leaving it on helps even more than just rinsing it off instantly.

What ended up happening was that I fell in love and purchased the full size. It's got a nice cooling feeling on your skin and it looks and feels like it has sucked up all the gunk that lives there. Leaves skin soft, smooth, and doesn't dry it out. The product mileage is insane; I only end up needing a few drops to cleanse my entire face. Seriously the best cleanser I have ever used, and I used to make a ""Sephora Sample Round"" so I've tried a lot.

In less than a week of using (every other day to let my skin adjust) I've noticed that it feels much smoother, including one of my trouble spots, the pores on my chin. I used to be able to feel teeny bumps there that are gone now, I'm assuming those were my pores saying ""help! I'm drowning in sebum!"" I've also noticed a dramatic improvement on my nose: the blackheads are either gone or significantly reduced, leaving just my pores. I'm really impressed with this scrub, and will probably continue to use it unless and until I find something more effective.

Like all the Sephora Collection cleansing wipes, these wipes are very sturdy and do not fall apart if you want to rinse them with warm water for extra cleansing duty, or to remove a mud mask. I buy the full-size packages for home and the car, but I also keep the mini-size in my purse because they’re perfectly compact and can double as a refreshing hand wipe. A summer tip: I keep a package of these watermelon wipes in the fridge for hot days when I want to cool off while removing my makeup.

Skin Type Oily",2 stars,"This rating is based less on the product itself and more so on the change in price and size of the product. This is an observation I’ve made and I thought that it would be beneficial for anyone thinking of buying or repurchasing this product. For approximately the last year, I have been exclusively using Sephora’s watermelon wipes. I like them; they make my skin feel clean without feeling overly dry or too greasy, they typically remove nearly the entirety of my eye makeup, and they smell quite nice. But it looks like Sephora is changing things up in order to save a penny. The last two times I purchased these wipes were on February 22, 2019 and April 26, 2019 (both times purchased online), and the wipes have significantly decreased in size in that one month period. I have also noticed that they have slightly increased the price as well, which I normally wouldn’t have minded as much so long as the product itself remained the same. The February wipes (Lot 81560 in the attached picture, on the right) cost $7.50 and measured in at 18 cm by 19 cm. The April wipes (Lot 8257E, on the left) now cost $8.00 and measure in at 19.5 cm by 13.5 cm. The second I took the first April wipe out of the package (I couldn’t find the Feb package I had already opened), I instantly thought that the wipe seemed quite a bit smaller than usual and the shape was off. But it wasn’t until today (May 9) that I was able to find the Feb package to directly compare the two. You can see in the attached picture that the newer wipes (on the left) are much smaller than the older ones (on the right). While it is certainly possible that this particular April lot is oddly shaped because of the release of the new mini size, I personally don’t think that is the case. Based on the dimensions of the wipes and after a bit of quick math, we’re essentially losing 5.75 wipes in each package. So really, we’re paying 50 cents more for only ~19 wipes now. TL;DR We are paying more for nearly 6 fewer wipes now.

You have to shake this really well before use because it has clay in it. I tend to use this toner in the mornings during my skincare, before I apply my foundation. I have really large pores so I try to make them appear as small as possible. It's virtually impossible to get rid of large pores, but you can minimize them. This helped to do just that and it also does a great job at keeping my skin from getting oily during the day. I tend to rotate different toners at night, but this is the only toner I use in the morning because I love the way it makes my skin look under Foundation. It has become a holy grail for me. And I think if you have oily skin and large pores you're going to enjoy this toner.

I also have some enlarged pores on my cheeks which have seemed to improve slightly but no miracles there. But what I'm most pleased with is the fact that after using this toner twice a day for 2 weeks my acne was totally cleared. I have sensitive combo oily skin with hereditary cystic acne. I've been on Accutane 3 times which reduced my acne greatly but I still get nasty breakouts mostly related to hormone cycle. This toner cleared my existing acne and actually prevents new breakouts. My skin has not been this clear in years. Was not expecting that from this product! I have been able to use lighter coverage foundation because my skin is so clear and my existing acne scarring has faded as well. Sorcery I tell you! Will definitely repurchase.

My recommendation to the world is to STOP buying expensive AHAs and BHAs and buy this instead. Use your leftover money for a good sunscreen and a great moisturizer. I have used this on my face, my feet, my armpits, and anywhere I am prone to razorburn, and when I do, life is good. Things to know: -Use this toner LIGHTLY at night. It stinks, and you're going to want to grease up heavily after... it also turns my skin a weird bruised color for several hours after use, so I prefer to not look into a mirror or see anyone else see me until it fades. -""Tingle"" is not anywhere near the word I'd use... ""burns like hellfire"" is more apt. Another reason to use at night. While it feels like you're on fire after use, your skin will feel invincible the next morning. -This makes an excellent spot treatment for any sensitive places, like ears, but use a cotton swab instead of a pad - it is hardcore, so limit the area. -Did I mention it stinks? It stinks. Vinegar for days, dude. All in all, best chemical exfoliator I've ever used. May also be good for pickling, though I've never tried.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"I tend to be quite skeptical of skincare these days, especially after doing more research on ingredients. I nearly didn't purchase this product because I thought the ""tingle"" sensation was just a marketing gimmick, but then I looked at the active ingredients. I was specifically looking for a toner with niacinamide, and unless I overlooked a bunch this seems to be one of only a couple offered at Sephora. I chose this one over the others because this one also contains other great exfoliating ingredients. Yes, there is a tingling sensation that occurs when using it, but to be honest you'll get the same tingling sensation from any toner that contains glycolic acids and other AHAs. Depending on how used to these ingredients you are will determine how much tingle you experience. I have sensitive skin and at first the tingling was almost too much. But as I started incorporating more AHAs into my nighttime skincare routine, the sensation becomes less intense. In conclusion I think that this is a great product based on the active ingredients. I may repurchase unless I can find a similar product that is cheaper.

It got rid of my malessezia (if you have this, you know the struggle), and my face actually glows. I'm 37 years old, and this is the first time I've ever had glowing skin...and it's from a Tarte product. I know the smell isn't your favorite (but I'm so appreciate that it's a ""clean""/non-fragrant product), and neither are my other favorites (that generally cost $250 for a few ounces)...but my God, this works. I would rub camel's urine on my face if I knew it worked as well as this product. I am so grateful for the product, and grateful that I don't, in fact, have to do that. Thank you, Tarte.

I have pretty dry skin, with some random dry patches and no acne or no history of acne, I am always on the hunt for a cleanser that CLEANS but also doesn't leave me with that weird film that ""hydrating cleansers"" do, but also doesn't leave me feeling as though I just got a face lift because of how dry it leaves me. THIS IS IT YALL. This cleanser cleanses my skin but doesn't strip me of every small bit of oil I have on my face.

The tiniest amount makes the richest, creamiest lather I’ve ever felt in a face wash (esp considering the price point!!). After I use it, I can definitely tell my skin feels clean, but not stripped. I typically have normal to oily skin, but lately I’ve been noticing my skin has been a little on the dry side. This cleanser paired with the complimentary moisturizer have been my favorite night time duo to keep my skin feeling hydrated, and in the morning I use the face wash with a lighter moisturizer with SPF. I truly have nothing but good things to say about this product!!

It took me forever to finally give the wipes a try. I was amazed when I did and mad for not trying them earlier. I'm the pickiest person about makeup wipes! I used these and they worked so well at taking off the makeup. Getting the grease and sweat off my face. Leaving your face glowy but still clean. It basically is a built in toner. So that is a huge plus. Didn't break out my acne prone skin. They left my face smelling so amazing (like some sort of citrus) and my husband was so into it, so that's a plus for sure! They are obviously a little more pricey than say Sephora Collection makeup wipes (which is what I always used, before these ones) but It's so worth it to get these! If you struggle with dark spots, discoloration, dry skin.. This is a fix all in my opinion. You can't go wrong with these!! And they are nice and big so you can chop them up and get more uses if you want! I usually cut mine in halfs and use a half in the morning when I wake up to freshen up (since I rarely actually wash my face), and another at night as the first step in my pre-bed skin routine! So anyway 10/10 do recommend, I'm in love with these wipes and I think they're going to be my faves for the rest of forever.

But, after going through a few cotton pads, my mascara hadn't budged, and my eye was getting sensitive from repeated, gentle cotton pad cleansings, I knew I'd have to move onto something else.

I bought the full size and used it every night when winter started because my skin was too dry for a face wash. It did make my eyes feel weird in the morning, so I started splashing my (closed) eyes with water after cleansing with this. I only wear very light makeup and just on my eyes, so I can't review how well it removes makeup, but I do two rounds with this on cotton pads and it gets everything off well. Lately I haven't been feeling quite as clean with this. I only use it twice a week now when my skin is too dry or sensitive to wash at night.

Kinda gross but, I could LITERALLY see it pulling stuff out of my pores! It acts as a magnet for clearing your pores. It is pretty magical stuff. My skin has never felt more smooth or clear. It is drying, but I use Sunday Riley facial oil right after. The combination of those two has perfected my skin. I have battled cystic acne, redness, and large pores for 15 years now. I have tried everything. This was the first product that truly transformed my skin.

I have mild eczema, and I have struggled for years to find an exfoliating wash that doesn't leave me extra dry or red. This is the only one I have consistently repurchased. The exfoliating beads are small and delicate, but there are tons of them. You can't directly see them in the product because they are so fine, but you really feel them working. The base of the product is also great, it is similar to Cetaphil or CeraVe gentle face washes, so the product exfoliates but does not over dry or strip the skin. It is very light, with minimal scent. I can even use this product in the fall and winter when my skin is at its most dry and red. I've recommended this product to tons of friends, and they all thank me for it.

This cleasner seemed to work immeditately! The first use it dried my problem areas without the rest of my skin! Plus my skin never felt tight after using so I knew it really was gentle. HOWEVER after about two weeks it completely faded. In fact I seem to be breaking out MORE and in a different way than usual! I always get a large breakout or two, now I get a bunch of tiny whiteheads (and still the big ugly ones)! I tired cutting out other skin care products I used to see if it was something else, but I have't been able to identify a different culprit. This cleasner I think would be perfect if you had very sensitive skin. My oily af skin needs something with a little more elbow grease unfortunately.

I tried this on a gut feeling after a different brand cleansing remover didn't work out as I'd hoped. The true test would be if it would be effective on my waterproof mascara. I often use the pads of my fingers to apply cleansing oil, and all my eye makeup – primer, shadow, waterproof gel eyeliner, and most of my waterproof mascara, went off within the first swipe! Passing the pads of my fingers over my lashline twice over, after that, and the rest of the mascara was gone! It was so quick and effective, the rest could be used to cleanse the rest of my face. So, it turns out I don't need much per makeup removal, very economical. Wash off with water, clean as a whistle! I double cleanse, but I could've been good as is. Second thing I was concerned about was breaking out afterwards, since my skin is HIGHLY sensitive and prone to breaking out. ZERO breakouts. I found my Holy Grail cleansing oil!

The consistency was very liquidy like water but then after some time it solidified into a milky thicker consistency. When I applied it on my face, it was very sticky and dried down that way. It also has a strong pen ink smell even though all these reviews say its ""odorless"" I dont know what to think but Im very disappointed. If anyone can leave a review in reply about whether this is supposed to be happening or if you experienced the same thing, I would be extremely grateful.

I gave this a shot because I use the all-day balancing serum and had a great experience with that. To begin, you only need a rain drop of the product to use. It’s extremely dense which makes a little go a long way. The odor smells so clean and fresh that it doesn’t give you a headache - and truly leaves your skin feeling great. Would recommend to anyone trying to get a new skincare routine - especially for oily skin.

I know it's marketed for all skin types, but I only would suggest it for combo or oily skin because it's on that borderline of leaving your skin too dry. I use about a pea-sized amount of cleanser, and I feel like I have a huge face (most of it my forehead lol), and I get a great lather and full on cleanse for all this square footage of face. My husband has normal skin, and he uses this also, but he's recently complained that he feels drier than usual; therefore, my caution above. I've been using this cleanser for about a year now, and I haven't had such soft, clear skin before. Sure my skin wasn't horrible before because I've been using great skincare for 12 years now, but this was a much-needed upgrade in my routine. I also use the AmorePacific cleansing oil for my double cleanse routine when I wear heavy and/or water resistant makeup, so when I do that, this gets used second.

The breakouts are even in odd places for me, such as above my upper lip and on my neck. I wish I knew which ingredient is the problem so I can avoid it in the future. If you have even slightly breakout prone skin, avoid this! It didn’t help with oil either.

Prior to switching to this cleanser, I was using Tatcha, another Japanese skincare brand, which I really wanted to love based on their ingredients and pretty packaging. I wasn't sure if I was breaking out these past few months due to this cleanser or due to traveling so much, as I tend to have ""sensitive"" skin in the sense that if I travel somewhere and sleep on sheets that aren't mine, it causes my face to break out. I actually used Boscia in the past and loved it, but obviously with all the different products out there and marketing hype, it's easy to get distracted. Tired of breaking out and using tea tree oil with only somewhat moderate success, I remember I had a travel size of this in my skincare closet. The first time I used it, my skin felt pretty dry, so I used an oil to moisturize, which I tend to normally do anyway. Within the 24 hours, holy crap, my painful pimples/acne were going down and disappearing. I've used this product for less than a week, but my skin has been rapidly clearing up. It's amazing. I get hyperpigmentation, so I'll probably have to exfoliate or something to help reduce the dark marks, but I'm never straying cleansers again. Boscia for the win!

NOTHING helped it. I mean, I didn’t really invest in skin care and I would try to go for the more affordable “amazing” products. But now I’m glad I made the choice to seriously invest. Everything I picked out, I did so much research on (who wants to waste money when they’re buying a whole skincare routine at once.) and I don’t regret any of it. ESPECIALLY this one! I will address the issues I see in some reviews: Yes, this is hard to wash off. But it’s worth it. I’m not sure if it actually gets clumped in peach fuzz, I purposely got a little in my eyebrow and scalp to test it out and it didn’t cling to little hairs at all. I seriously observed all of the action as I’ve used this the past couple weeks and from what I can see, I’ve come to the conclusion that this product actually clumps up in my dead skin, which is actually a good thing because it shows that it’s really clinging to it and doing great with removing it. So that whole debate on if the little clumps are dead skin or the product itself? I think it’s both. So, remember I said how my skin was this gross oily flaky texture? Nothing would help it. It got to the point where I was willing to use a washcloth to try and rub the flakes off and id scrub it pretty hard. I was so sick of my skin that I was willing to damage it. Which still didn’t even help. No exfoliation’s, toners, face cleansers, nothing. The very first night I used this, the amount of clumps that I saw was insane! (they reduced over time as my skin came to life)But what was even more shocking was that once I rinsed this off, literally ALL of my oiliness, dryness, and flakiness instantly vanished. My skin immediately became baby smooth. It was actually emotional for me because it was the best my skin has ever looked in my life. My skin never gets annoyingly flaky now.

I would scratch at it to try and get rid of it, but it's such a sensitive area and everything that I could think that might remove it was too abrasive. Anyways, I went into Sephora just looking for an exfoliator to deal with sebum and dry skin and an associate recommended this product to me. At this point, I had totally forgotten about the dead skin under my eyes until I used it and looked in the mirror and the dead skin was gone!

I do not however dermaplane, so I have very fine blonde hairs which have never caused a problem with any other skincare product I’ve ever used. I followed the directions listed on the bottle. I did feel like it exfoliated certain areas of my face, my forehead and cheeks especially. Upon rinsing, I noticed that it had balled up and literally adhered it’s self into my baby facial hairs. It took scrubbing with a wet ole Henriksen complexion sponge, a dry washcloth and some tweezers to get it completely off. This left my jaw line red and inflamed. I gave 2 stars because I feel like it did Exfoliate some areas, but the sticking to my face will 100% make me return the product. Not worth the $34 retail I paid. There are other products on the market that deliver similar or better results without the pilling.

Don't let the reviews about pilling and getting caught in peach fuzz deter you from trying this product. The peach fuzz balls remove easily with warm water, and the more you use the product the less it gets caught in facial hair. The pilling up is part of the exfoliant process - think of using balled up glue to remove residual glue, and that's pretty much what happens with this product and your skin.

This has a thinner and silkier consistency compared to Clinique and it takes a little more of this balm to get all your makeup off, so you end up going through the container a little quicker. However, I found that this product removed my waterproof mascara better than Clinique’s Take The Day Off. So it has its pros and cons, but since I usually double cleanse regardless, I think I might prefer how long a small jar of Clinique lasts me. I feel like I’m getting more bang for my buck. That’s not to say that this cleansing balm isn’t absolutely amazing, because it is,... I’m just sharing my personal preference. I would gladly use this product again, or even buy a large jar if there was a good deal or sale.

There could be no other explanation for the breakouts but this makeup remover. I am now stuck with this big jar of MU remover. I guess it will be trash.

IMO any product with rose in it is hit or miss because it is one of those scents that can easily come off as overpowering. One of the possible culprits in this that makes it too strong smelling is the addition of chamomile flower extract ie. Anthemis nobilis. The advertised strengths of this toner would be its cooling sensation and gentleness which sounds appealing. However I couldn't bring myself to spray on my face. If you are leery of heavy scents, I strongly suggest sampling on a cotton ball or something other than your skin. I received this in Play!

My 2-year-old son and I both have eczema (dry itchy skin with some scaly patches) and this works wonderfully to soothe itchiness and redness. I slather it on my legs before jumping in the shower so that it had time to warm up while washing my hair, etc, then add shaving cream over it to shave my legs and it has stopped the razor burn & itchy dry feeling I always get after shaving. I add a dollop to a hot bath and use it as a bath oil. I use it after showering for my entire body.

I tried the Kopari on one leg and the grocery store (organic) on the other and the Kopari seemed to sink into the skin while still leaving a glossy protective film. The grocery store oil sat on top of my skin, was quite oily and didn’t seem to sink in and hydrate like the Kopari. I wish this wasn’t the case because I would prefer to pay 5 bucks instead of $37 but I have to be honest and fair in what my experience was. I’m buying the large size of the Kopari. I have desert dry skin that literally cracks in the winter and is very painful. Hope this is helpful. Oh yes, and no annoying fragrance just a delicate coconut smell from the ingredient.

Skin Type Combination",4 stars,"I got this a while back in a Play box and finally got around to using it when I ran out of makeup remover and was too lazy to restock. The oil was solid when I opened it, which I prefer, but the lid arrived a bit loose and had leaked around the rim and made for a messy first use. I scrape the product out with the back of my nails (though a spatula would definitely work better) and the heat of my hands melts it in seconds. Works ok removing foundation and regular eye makeup, but I have to run my fingers under the faucet a couple rounds and gently rub my lids to get liquid eyeliner and mascara off completely. Since rinsing leaves a layer of gunk, I follow up with a foaming cleanser. I have dry skin so it doesn't make me break out nor does it feel pore clogging with double cleansing. Prob works better as a body moisturizer but for the price vs. size of a jar, I have other go-to brands. Similarly, there are much better clean makeup removers that Sephora carries. Might be nice to travel with if carrying on since it's multipurpose.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"Initially I wasn't so sure about shelling out $40 for a cleanser but the amount of product you get will probably last all year if you're only cleansing your face twice a day. I only use half a pump as well, not to be conservative but a full pump is too much for my face. I love the good ingredients in this product plus being free of sulfates, parabens, unnecessary fragrances, dyes, etc. The cleanser isn't super foamy or stripping but has a nice creamy/milky consistency when a bit of water is added and is massaged onto the face. In the morning my face feels clean and ready for the day after washing with this and applying the Jack Black Double Duty spf 20 moisturizer (which also works well for me underneath my makeup). In the evening after using a makeup wipe this cleanser gently cleans off my remaining makeup and my skin doesn't feel like it's stripped of oils and dried out. The smell isn't bad either, fairly herbal due to the ingredients (looking at you sage and rosemaries) but not overwhelming and I enjoy it. I always look forward to washing my face with this product. All in all I will continue to use this product because of the amount you get for the price plus the way it performs, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try a new cleanser. Oh my only beef with it is the pump head popped off when I recieved it but it still works so it wasn't a big deal. I would have been choked if the pump was totally broken though, maybe they could up their game in how they ship this product so the pump doesn't break via shipping.

I was told that there weren't any cleansers did the job perfectly, I'd just have to accept a double cleanse routine of some sort. Well lady you were WRONG!!! I got a sample of this cleanser and two others to try out, gave this one a go when I got home and there was nothing left on my skin when I went in afterwards with a micellar water. No mascara, no mineral foundation. Wasn't super foamy and didn't leave my skin feeling really stripped afterwards which was nice (wasn't exactly hydrating but better than a lot of foaming cleansers I've tried). I'd guess this wouldn't take off everything if you wear lots of makeup, but this absolutely exceeded my expectations.

So much so that I got curious and tried it myself. It's a great, simple cleanser that does the job. I can see why my husband likes it. He's struggled with sensitive skin and breaks out of any excess oil on this skin, but then using some of the products either dried out his skin and stripped off any moisture from his face, I mean, the struggle was real. So this product along with it's moisturizer, have become his holy grail of facial routine. Simple, to the point and gets the job done.

I am not sure what ingredient seems to work miracles on my skin but whatever it is, I love it. The only reason why i am giving it 4 stars is because it is a bit drying for my skin - i am starting to have a bit more dryness now and I wish it was not an a physical exfoliator. I would recommend to those battling acne.

I’m a firm believer that cleansers should be as gentle as possible - leave the active ingredients to your toners and serums. I used to have really unbalanced, super oily, sensitive skin and prone to congestion and occasional cysts. This was back when I was using gel/foaming cleansers meant to “control” oily skin and treat breakouts, little did I know it was just stripping my skin dry and making things worse!! This bar totally balanced my skin out and it has never looked more healthy and bright. I also use the Peekee bar as a morning cleanser. Highly highly recommend this product and the entire product line from Drunk Elephant.

I decided to give it a try and it has been my holy grail ever since! I’ve been using it for about 2 and a half years now and I don’t plan on every switching to another face wash. The JuJu Bar helped me with my acne and acne scarring! I like using this after ive taken all my makeup off and not as a way to take off my makeup. I also pat it dry after using so that it doesn’t soak and get mushy, causing the exfoliating purpose to be useless.

I had been using it in the mornings and at night after my cleansing balm that removes my makeup, and did this for about 5 weeks. I started getting breakouts (some cystic, mostly surface/whiteheads) about 2 weeks after, but I was trying another new product, so I wasn't sure which one was the culprit. After eliminating one for 3 weeks and vice versa, I figured out this product was the issue. I'm not sure what ingredient didn't work for me (I wish I did so I could avoid it), but this was a no from me dawg. Gonna give it another couple of weeks of break on my skin with new products and then I'll try the Pekee Bar, which also came in the travel duo I got. I'll post on that product if it also causes issues, or it's mind blowing (the only times I review stuff). Should that interest you.

I bought the three-step kit, but I knew for sure this product was the main reason why my skin cleared. I stopped using this toner for a while; I wanted to try a different cleanser(i did not like the cleanser it came with), and the new cleanser and others broke out my skin instead. Finally, I found a new cleanser that works, and along with the toner, it has cleared my skin a lot.

But as an oily skinned person, this toner is my favorite! It feels really refreshing but also doesn't sting or burn. It has made my face really clear. Definitely put on a generous amount sunscreen after using this as it does make your face more sensitive to sunlight. I have noticed I have gotten a few freckles (more than usual) near my hairline where my sunscreen can't reach :/

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"This is weird. It's now my favorite cleanser.... a bar... of soap... is my favorite thing for my face. But my skin doesn't lie. This bar soap feels so freaking amazing on my hands when I moisten it, lather, and WONDERFUL on my face. It doesn't take much water or lathering of the bar itself to get enough on your hands for a thorough cleanse- which was surprising for me btw. And the bar doesn't necessarily stay super moist after, just dripping product down into the soap dish. It actually kind of dries up quickly and gives you the piece of mind that it's not a waste of product... That was my main concern with my first purchase of this (and JuJu)... that it would feel like a waste. And it's not at all. Secondly, I was concerned that it would be weird and messy to cleanse with a soap bar. I mean, who even does that anymore? I don't even use bar soap for my hands unless it's that spa stuff at a fancy hotel. In some weird way, cleansing with this soap doesn't feel awkward. The soap, like mentioned above, is super soft and feels so unbelievably nourishing on your face. My face doesn't feel like it's just been soap-stripped. In fact, it almost feels like I've actually just moisturized recently (without the residue). I absolutely love this. I actually get excited to use my Pekee bar (and the JuJu). As long as DE keeps this product the way it is, I can't see a reason why I've ever change out my cleanser now. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to take a chance on a bar of soap again.

Because this bar isn’t drying at all and my skin is super sensitive and dry during these winter months. I also happen to struggle with hormonal acne, and there’s very few products out there that touch it. This cleansing bar has made a HUGE improvement in my skin and has my hormonal acne breakouts almost completely controlled. It’s gentle, has no scent, lathers beautifully, and leave you soft and ready for your skincare. Use along with other clean products (toner, serum, oil, moisturizer) and watch your face transform after a couple weeks of use. I highly recommend this product. After trying most of the cleansers offered by Sephora, this IMO is the best option by far.

To save money I tried using a comparable drugstore version of this, but it dries me out. Verdict? If you're okay with using a bar formulation for your daily cleanser, I definitely recommend.

Ceramic Clay Slip was my go-to, it was the best cleanser I'd ever tried in my life, and I repurchased it for years. But once the ""Clay"" in Ceramic Slip got dropped, it all went downhill. The consistency feels much oilier now, no longer refreshing, and feels like a film sitting on top of your skin after washing off. This new formula ended up breaking me out and I was so sad, it was back to the drawing board to find a new HG cleanser. This seems to be a pattern with Sunday Riley within the last year, and the unfortunate thing is the company is not being forthright about the changes to their most famous formulas (Good Gene's being the biggest culprit...nothing like it once was, many long-time users agree and SR just denies it). It's such a shame, because the products seriously worked wonders! But now, not nearly as effective and the same high prices don't reflect the obvious changes. If this was two years ago, I would've enthusiastically recommended this cleanser without hesitation. However, as a long-term Sunday Riley consumer, I unfortunately have to say this is a definite ""pass."" There are far better cleansers out there to spend your hard earned dollars on.

It has a pleasant but not overwhelming smell. I’m super sensitive to perfumes and tend to buy everything unscented so I was a bit worried at first that there was a scent at all but it’s a very delicate smell that dissipates very soon after you wash your face and doesn’t irritate my nose or my face. The whole experience of washing my face with this cleanser feels indulgent and my face feels clean and soft after I wash. It doesn’t feel tight or dry like it does with other cleansers. I wouldn’t recommend this product as a stand-alone for washing off heavy makeup, but I finds it works well if you use an oil based cleanser first to do a two step face wash. I am in my late 30s and have combination skin with an oily t-zone and so far this product has proven to be enough of a good purchase that I am on my third bottle.

After a couple of uses (this is marketed as a daily cleanser) I started to notice how tight and dry my skin felt and I’m as oily as can be. Also, the texture feels more like something you’d put your skin through once a week as an exfoliating treatment, not as a part of your daily cleansing routine. However, I wouldn’t recommend physical exfoliators anyways, just google micro-tears and maybe you’ll move onto chemical exfoliators like I did. Try at your own risk but this product can definitely be rough on skin. That, combined with its price tag and possibly ruining your skin in the long run, I’d steer clear.

I use the juju less frequently because my skin has been dry, but it is great for post micellar cleanse on the one or two days each week that I wear full makeup. Since using them I’ve been less prone to breaking out after wearing makeup. My skin is combo, oily nose and chin with dry neck and normal everywhere else. The bars haven’t gone down much in size, so I estimate them to last at least 6 months since I still use a foaming or gel wash in the morning. Full size is a better value if you use only one formula and use it twice a day, but I would rather have the small bars to get the variety and a fresh bar more often. We have hard water and I found that these leave skin feeling surprisingly clean without any oily or talc type residues left behind. When they run out I will repurchase. Both bars fit together well in a travel soap dish.

If I use it at my bathroom sink, no matter how many times I rinse, I always find some granules left on my skin afterwords. So I have to use it under the shower head. My face doesn't feel dry - it feels as if I've already applied something. It leaves your skin smooth because of the good polishing, however, it feels rather gooey and tacky, which I'm not crazy about. It doesn't get rid of your make up, so you must use it on a clean face. I don't hate it but this isn't better than many others I've used. So I won't but it again.

I've only used this on my T-zone and while it seems to leave the pores on my nose looking clearer, I find it a surprisingly harsh product to use. Additionally, it is REALLY hard to rinse off. Even after copious rinsing, I can still feel grains of the scrub on my face and have to use a warm face cloth and then more rinsing to get them all off. I much prefer the Dr. Brandt exfoliating scrub, which I find more effective and very gentle for such an effective product.

I was a bit scared to buy one because in the past, many exfoliators broke my face out! But I needed one badly because my skin had so many dry patches and dead skin. especially on my nose. I needed something for sensitive skin and I bought this after reading the reviews on here. I'm glad I did! It's perfect for sensitive skin, and leaves my skin with a natural shine after. Just make sure you don't rub it too hard onto your skin like I did the first I used it lol! Also, a little goes a long way! I use this about twice a week (NO MORE THAN THAT). After each use, I use REN's evercalm rescue mask. They work great together. It's pricey, but worth it imo. It removed all the dead skin I had.

I could immediately tell that my skin was a different clean from when I used my harsh cleaning methods. The cleanser left my skin soft and clean. I can tell a difference in the appearance of my skin for the better on just using the cleanser twice a day (morning and before bedtime) over the last 4 days. I definitely recommend this cleanser for anyone with aging, oily skin. The cleanser is pricey in cost but it does go a long way as one tiny drop or pump goes a long way once lathered up. Because the cleanser works on my skin so well I am interested in using other products from the line that are suited for my skin.

I've tried a few hypoallergenic products that either do not remove make up or cleanse my skin well or they totally strip my skin even though they all say they won't. My skin was bumpy and just gross. I finally went into sephora and an employee recommended a few things and I decided to try the skin fix cleanser. First of all ONE PUMP of this cleanser completely removes a full face of makeup without even removing eye makeup first. Secondly, my skin feels so clean my pores are stimulated and my skin feels soft and supple it does not strip my skin AT ALL. Of course I still need other treatments for my rosacea but the skinfix is just what I've been needing in a cleanser. My only ""complaint"" is I wish they had a basic moisturizer to accompany it as their other products are out of my price range. Overall my skin texture improved, it's soft, never dry, and a little goes a long way making it totally worth the money.

Barely takes makeup off; using just straight up olive oil on your face is so much more effective than this product. I generally enjoy products from this brand, but this cleanser was a big swing-and-a-miss for me.

There’s no sticky residue, it doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped, and the best part is it never ever stings my eyes whenever I’m removing eye makeup.

At first I wasn’t so sure about this because it wasn’t a foaming formula, and the oil felt like I needed some extra elbow grease to really scrub my face for that squeaky clean feeling, but wow, this isn’t that type of cleanser. Instead the oil softened my skin considerably, and it cleaned and purified it after just the first use. I rubbed it onto dry skin for about 15 seconds, then added a tiny dollop to my Mia 2 and let that do the work for the next minute. Then I used a hot towel and wiped it all really well, and voila, baby smooth skin and a to-die-for glow! I had to get used to there being no foam, which I love, but somehow my skin just feels cleaner and fresher. There’s no taut skin feeling, which I usually love for that squeaky clean, freshly scrubbed face I get from a foaming cleanser, but this is different. After several days, my skin even looked more radiant and I felt I could even go sans makeup! Expensive, yes, but so worth it! At night I even mix it with my St Ives exfoliator and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing off in the shower. Talk about a real treat! It smells like a spa!

The cleansers are awesome and this one on particular, if you use it on dry skin and massage for about 2-4 minutes, will leave you glowing and with less break outs. It’s not a clay or a normal gel like cleanser, it’s like a creamy gel that turns into an oil once you rub it in. It’s honestly a great treat at night, the smell is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and I did not get a reaction from it. I also left it on for like 3 other mins so it could do its magic. It is not drying at all. Just note that you definitely need a double cleanse, this stuff doesn’t take off makeup. You def. need a oil balm or oil cleanser prior to this. 2 pumps is good enough to cover face and neck.

I like that you don't need to apply with a pad, so you're not wasting product (though I suppose some is lost in the air). I just pat into my skin and let it absorb. It seems to have good ingredients, particularly amino acids (probably good for you, right?). I also like the natural scent. I'm almost done with my first bottle, and I'm not sure if it's made any huge difference in my skin, and I do question whether the natural oils in the toner may form a barrier against any serums/treatments that I use next. Also, a bit pricey.

I have dry acne prone skin and I personally like it better than the previous toners I have tried. I spray like 3-4 times on my face, then I “pat and hold” the product all over my face and neck to evenly distribute the product. It makes me feel refreshed. I took a star out because I honestly don’t know if it does anything that makes you say “WOW”; my makeup still kind of flakes a bit. It obviously doesn’t have the hydration of a moisturizer and I’m too lazy to use a moisturizer since I’m always in a rush. This does a pretty nice job at making my dry skin feel a bit less dry though. My acne prone skin has been under control as well. I still do break out here and there sometimes (because I sleep in my makeup sometimes, I’m so lazy) lmao.. but this just overall makes my skin feel so good after I use it. It’s hard to explain. I don’t mind it’s smell that everyone complains about. If anything I actually like it, and it goes away after it sinks into your skin. It doesn’t irritate my skin either. I like it and will purchase again!

Many years ago I noticed that not only did it lift dirt and oil from my skin and keep it clear, when I had a cold and got those rough red flakes around my nose, it instantly lifted those and didn't even sting. If you don't have super oily skin, use a lower level of clarifying lotion. They are quite specific. Maybe one day I'll have to move down one or even two levels but at age 65 this still works for me.

It gave me a clearer complexion within a week, and my skin absorbed my moisturizer much better as a result. My only complaint is that this did sting my face a little while applying, so I wouldn’t recommend it for sensitive skin... But overall, I liked how easy it was to use and apply this product. Plus, the small deluxe sample bottle lasted me much longer than expected... I am just now about to finish it after over a month of daily use, so a little goes a long way with this. It’s a great value whether you buy it as part of their 3-step system or decide to use it solo. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable skincare routine, especially because Clinique makes 3 other clarifying lotions depending on your skin type.

I have never experienced any burning or a greasy residue after use. Another great feature of this product is that you can use it as is and not have to rinse it off. It is expensive and the prices on all Koh Gen Do products when up a few months ago but it is a great investment if you want to spend extra on better skincare products.

I recently decided to make a switch to using primarily oil cleansers, and had to spend so much time looking for one that doesn't contain a plethora of unnecessary and/or negative ingredients that I was almost tempted to just diy it (wouldn't have ended well, that much is sure). Thankfully, I finally found this one, and I would definitely recommend this cleanser over most other brands' oil cleansers. The four main oils this includes in its ingredients are all relatively low on the comedogenic scale, which, nice. It does have added fragrance, which is unfortunate, but otherwise fits all my wants. I don't wear a lot of makeup, but what I do wear (a little concealer, eyeshadow) it melts off perfectly. On days when I don't wear makeup I just use this on its own. Two to three pumps dispenses just the right amount of product. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, and with none of the tight, dry sensation you might get from many foaming cleansers. I have combination skin with easily clogged pores, especially on my forehead, and so far this hasn't broken me out from daily use. I'm very happy with this product.

The oil had a thicker consistency than I was used to, so that is why I had to knock off a star. I felt that I had to use more pressure (and i'm trying to prevent premature aging) on my skin to work the product in to break down my makeup. It did an excellent job at breaking down my makeup and sunscreen and it emulsified well with water. I did feel like there was a slight residue afterwards, but I do a double cleanse so it did not bother me too much. The packaging is cute but it would have been nicer if the bottle was not opaque so you could see exactly when you were going to run out. The price was pretty decent for the amount you received. This product lasted me about 2-3 months with daily use. Overall, I DEFINITELY recommend this. If you're looking for a cleansing oil that works on sensitive skin, you should give this a shot!

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"I just switched to an oil-based cleanser, and selected this one based on it’s ingredients. Unlike most others on Sephora, this does not include essential oils (fragrant plant oils), which may be considered “clean” by whoever sets those standards but are actually extremely bad for your skin...it’s nothing but marketing and bad science to add them to face care products, they are every bit as inflammatory and cytotoxic as synthetic fragrance. THIS stuff is incredible. Leaves my skin so soft and does deeply cleanse without stripping. I tested it by wiping a cotton pad with toner after cleaning on a day I wore a “full face” and it came back spotless. I trust the ingredients and the results! The ingredients are simple, oils and emulsifiers (latter is reason it rinses off easily, taking the oily gunk with it) and I have seen a huge improvement in my skin.

It felt moisturizing but I just didn’t feel clean at all. It felt like I was just rubbing on wet moisturizer and then rinsing it off. The smell was pretty strong too. If it left me feeling clean it would’ve been totally okay with me but I actually had to return it. Giving 2 stars because I hope it can at least be good for someone else, wish I could’ve loved it!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"Wow. Hands down my holy grail discovery of 2019. The product is incredibly comforting and soothing- from the instant it is used. By itself, it works extremely well to soothe redness and irritation. This is absolutely bolstered using other products in the line. I would describe the product as being milky, smooth, and lightly hydrating. It is very easy to spread around the face, erasing any chance of pulling or accidental physical exfoliation with your hands. I double cleanse and do not use this to remove makeup, so I can't speak to that element of the cleanser. As someone with extremely sensitive skin and many of the issues that go along with this, I have seen massive improvements in redness and inflammation since using this product. It also works really well if I have a pimple or small breakout, since it is so calming it drastically decreases the size and appearance of blemishes by reducing inflammation. Another thing I love about this product is its packaging- a lot of product comes in here, and one full pump is exactly enough for perfect full coverage of the face. I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive, slightly dry skin.

Personally, it’s a solid choice and I enjoy using it in rotation but it’s not my favorite cleanser. I’m giving it 5 starts for my parents (early 60s) who tried a sample I had and love it. My biggest complaint is that I feel like it leaves a sort of film over my face when I get out of the shower, but that’s the reason my mom loves it. She says it’s perfect for cleansing without drying out her skin. What I love most about it is the super calming fragrance that I enjoy in all of REN’s products. I originally bought it for redness relief but I don’t think it was very effective for that. If you love cleansing milk or have dry skin this is a great choice.

It went from normal to combination to oily to dry and sun damaged to poof add some hormonal acne. My skin was an absolute nightmare... until now! After using the cleansing milk for only a few days my skin felt amazingly soft and looked alive again.

A week after using this, redness was GONE. My acne was GONE except for the odd hormonal zit. I all of a sudden could wear tinted moisturizer and didn't need full coverage foundation! I've been using it non-stop ever since, and I'm so happy Sephora has started to carry it (please stock the travel size and the giant pump bottle size!).

It does such an amazing job at removing dirt and impurities without stripping my skin or drying it out, and it's pH-balancing. It also smells super relaxing. However, Dermalogica self proclaims they're the first to create the double cleanse method, which is why they have a ""Pre-cleanse"" system in oil or balm form as your step one to remove makeup. I loveeeeee the Pre Cleanse Balm and have lash extensions and have never had an issue with using that or it irritating my lashes.

I don’t have acne a lot but when I do I want to make sure my products are helping. This toner is good for general facial toning/cleaning but I wouldn’t recommend for trying to help blemishes, redness, color pigmentation, etc.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"TL;DR: For a $10 cleanser this is absolutely amazing, would def recomend!! **little disclaimer: I just started actually caring about my skincare routine so all the products I have used before were of the same price range, just from the local pharmacy stores (Walgreens + CVS). All the cleansers before hand felt like they did enough. However, once I tried this I realized they did absolutely nothing for me. Those maintained my acne at the same level. The Salicylic Cleanser + an occasional routine of a niacinamide serum and moisturizer started clearing up my skin. I had maybe 1-2 pimple every week since I started using this which is about 2 months. As I said it was an occasional routine so I never really knew how effective it was until I vacationed in an area with a different climate. Due to the new climate I needed to be consistent. And wow all of a sudden the simple (and consistent) routine had me the clearest I had ever been. Unfortunately I forgot the cleanser and bought another salicylic cleanser from my local pharmacy.That is when I learned not all Salicylic cleansers are created equal! My face is now textured from little white heads that want to form. My skin tends to break out in pimples so for me the new white heads were alarming. With that being said... This is definitely a repurchase! I haven't used luxury brands so I can't speak on that but don't waste your $10 on a cleanser that sort of works when you can get something that puts in that work! If you're looking for a Salicylic Cleanser THIS IS THE ONE :) Thank you for coming to my Ted talk and I hope this helped you out.

I routinely breakout with pimples (either from decreased water intake, stress, my period or just because my face feels like it). Washing my face with this product after cleaning makeup off my face in the evening and when I wake in the morning has been keeping my pimples at bay and drying them out to heal. That being said it will dry your skin out so please do use a hydrating oil, serum, liquid or cream. Since you are putting acid on your face, you should be using sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher as it can make your face more susceptible to sun damage. Overall it's an affordable cleanser that will prevent and rid current pimples without fuss or a fancy smell.

In my experience, all of my makeup comes off- it does leave a bit of a film on my face, but it goes away quickly. I notice when I wipe my mascara off, it makes my vision go a little blurry, so I try to wipe off my mascara with something else, and then just use these on the rest of my face- they seem very effective.

I went through a ""let's get serious"" about skincare phase and it was too much too fast because so many different product combos nearly distorted my beautiful face. I nearly cried from how bad my break out was and I couldn't pin point what the heck was causing it. Long story short I return all the products sooo many people seemed to rave over on Instagram and YouTube and went with the brand that has never failed be in the past. BOOM!!!! It was like facial crack over night my breakout had disappeared like if it never existed. I love how smooth it applies to your face, the scent is amazing and not overbearing, it's a freaking two in one for Christ sake!!!! And my face has never felt so clean and vibrant. I usually apply it to my face as a mask first and then apply water and cleanse I feel like I get a deeper clean that way. Give it a try trust me you can go wrong especially if you want that fleeky glow in the am!

Smell wasn't my favorite, but it didn't bother me so when I ran out I got a less expensive toner because it's a step I don't care to spend a lot of money on. Then I got pregnant, my skin was pretty lack luster but I blamed it on the hormones. My nose got perpetually red at the tip, inflamed no matter what I did, and makeup wasn't sitting well on my skin. That's when I was looking through pictures of the year before and noticing how amazing my skin had been, and that the only major change I had made was the toner. So I bought this a week ago and my nose is healing, my skin is already looking luminous, and acting better in every way. I'm sold for life.

I definitely will continue to use it, not sure if I will buy it again (although I hear it lasts a loooong time), or try another essence.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"My favourite essence for instant hydration. My makeup application looks flawless when I use this essence. It has a nice floral scent which I like, but if you are sensitive to fragranced products I would recommend you to try it out at a store before purchasing because you do notice it. A little goes a long way and I love applying it on my fresh, cleansed skin. My favourite way to apply it is applying the drops on my skin and gently using my hand’s warmth and pressure to let it get absorbed better. You’ll immediately see plumped, glowy and hydrated skin. I personally don’t like the packaging because it is too bulky so I hope they repackage it one day. The big red bottle is a very unique statement piece on my vanity but it also gives me a heart attack every time I almost drop it or push it over. It’s a little awkward to hold because of its rectangular shape. I like trying out new skincare products all the time, but whenever my skin needs a boost in hydration I always come back to this. I’d say if you are interested in Shiseido’s skincare lineup, you should definitely try this one. I used to love all of Shiseido’s products but so many of their new products are quite underwhelming and gimmicky. Their timeless products like this essence and sunscreen are definitely a must try though. I always recommend waiting at least 3 months for results with skincare products, but I promise you that you’ll see a difference with this essence after one use. Just remember to “seal in” the essence with a night cream.

The scent was nice and light, and it definitely cleanses my face with a nice foamy application. My issue was how my skin felt and look after using it. I even tried to use it for more than a week or two in case my face needed some time to adjust but the more I used it the worse my skin became. My cheeks began to develop these little bumps that I didn’t get before. I believe they’re called milia but I’m not a dermatologist. No, I did not wear make up during the time I was testing out this cleanser. Yes, I exfoliate my skin and I wash my face thoroughly. Unfortunately now, I am stuck with a cleanser I barely used and will never use again AND my face is uglier than before I started using this product. That’s two things I’m never getting back, my complexion and my money. Before and after included no filters no edits

(OK, it's pretty good against my They're Real! mascara but I do still need to swipe some micellar water or whatever under my eyes after washing my face to avoid that raccoon look. Alas.). I think I'd read some other reviewers' comments on its ""soapy"" smell when I was researching it , and I have to agree--I don't love this kind of scent but I've grown accustomed to it, and it beats how some fragrance-free products wind up just smelling of the chemicals of which they're composed. Soapy scent notwithstanding, this is really an excellent cleanser. Highly recommend!

I use it in the morning, and when I get home from work. The difference in my skin texture and health since starting using this is madness.

I've never ever written a review in my life but have been wanting to get on here to write one because this product made such a difference in my skin, and I want other people to benefit from it the way I have. I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts. I have tried everything - moisturizers for oily skin, prescription benzoyl peroxide products, Differin...nothing worked. I didn't see a difference in my skin with any of them. I decided to give this product a try after a friend said that a toner may make all of the difference in my skin. She was right. Since using this product, I have had MAYBE one pimple. My skin is still pretty oily, but boy is this stuff controlling my breakouts. I couldn't be happier. I am having to apply minimal makeup to my skin and feel so much more confident because this product is keeping breakouts at bay. It may be a little pricey but for me it's so worth it.

Soft skin, reduced blackheads, etc; didn’t hesitate to order the full size. When it arrived, I upped my usage to 1x daily as recommended. Considering the fact that I don’t have sensitive skin and had been using the product already, when my skin broke out into the most horrific full-face breakouts I have EVER had, I looked to everything else as the potential culprit. It took me almost two months to blame this cleanser—particularly since the breakouts got more or less intense depending on where I was in my cycle, so I thought the issue could be more serious/hormonal. Nope. I just get oilier at certain times and this “deep dive” made a point of accentuating that regularity. With ridiculous numbers of whiteheads and honestly scabby-feeling dry spots. The long and the short of it is probably that I am not well-suited to the glycolic acid, and regular use dried the ever-living heck out of my face. I can accept that as my responsibility. But holy heck, be aware that this product can cause such a severe reaction because I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

But for days I had on no or minimal makeup it works great, but still needed a cloth after emulsifing the cleanser. If I don't use a cloth I felt like there was a film on my face. So maybe a bit too heavy for my liking. Not drying at all. The scent is very strong if you are bothered by that, I didn't mind it but my husband hated it.

While I enjoyed massaging my face with the thicker, more luxurious feeling oil, it took significantly longer to remove all traces of makeup compared to any cleansing oil I've used in the past. The process of washing off the product was not super pleasant either. I found the oil a bit slimy upon removal.

I only need to spray 3 to 4 times and never have to wipe any excess in with a cotton pad.

I have an oily T-zone and on most days I use this as my only cleanser but I double cleanse with it as well. It doesn’t have a strong scent, lasts a long time, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I’ve tried other cleansing oils (like Biossance) and found they break me out and left my skin feeling dry. It has also never stung my eyes but I don’t use it as my primary eye makeup remover. If I’m wearing waterproof makeup it will not remove it all but it will lossen it up and make it much easier to take off with a makeup remover.

Like, they do a good job at work but they talk about their relationship too much and it just kinda bothers you. This lady has squalene, which I enjoy very much, but it also has so many essential oils and some other things that I don't enjoy very much. It doesn't emulsify up very well, either. I mean, it does emulsify with some water added, but it's just not very satisfying. My skin feels nice when I wash it off, but I just wish the ingredients list was more simple. Also, like, I thought this brand was supposed to be super natural and wholesome, but after doing some research, it's not really??

Maybe... but I wouldn't buy it specifically for that. It is a gentle solution for removing makeup though, which can help retain moisture in the skin. I highly recommend following with a cleanser, as this doesn't clean as deep and completely by itself in my opinion, and that could explain some of the lower reviews this items has gotten. Overall, I would recommend.

I have combination skin that leans more towards oily - just gets dry in the winter. I also have a condition that tends to mess with my hormones so I have been breaking out a lot lately. I tried a billion different facial cleansers from all natural to medical to super expensive to pharmacy store aisle, and everything either aggravated my adult acne even more, or did absolutely nothing. This leaves my face feeling firm, crisp, and clean throughout the whole day, and I haven't had a breakout since using it!

I was previously using Lush coalface but they changed their formula so I had to seek out an alternative. It was a happy accident because this is so much better on my sensitive skin. I have been using the clear cpmplexion moisturizer for years and can't live without it. If everything breaks you out this is worth a try. Very nice foam and highly concentrated so you need very little product each time. I do wish the bottle was transparent so you could see where your supply was. I waited 30 days before writing this for a full skin turnover and i'm very happy with the results.

I received this little bottle of elixir pulled straight from the fountain of youth, and HOLY GRAIL! Although a tad pricey, a little bit goes a very long way. Having said that, this product does indeed do exactly what it claims. The first week of use, it most certainly did pull all of the impurities to the top and I have NEVER had such horrendous acne ads I did that first week. After soldiering through that nightmare of pimplistic proportions, my skin has regained its youthful, plump, amazingly soft complexion, AND I noticed an exorbitant difference in the fine lines on my forehead, beside my mouth, under eyes, and crow's feet almost immediately, definitely after 2 uses. Definitely follow the directions and only use every other day or it will dry thre crap out od your skin. This is now going to be a must have staple. LOVE!!!

It appears less irritated and more hydrated. I am excited to see what I see after using Alpha H Liquid Gold for the next few months!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"tl;dr version - this cleanser feels exquisite while using, and finds the impossible balance between actually cleaning your skin, but not leaving it dry and stripped. The significant scent of vanilla is ( to me ) non-irritating and pleasant, but might put off some people. I’m pickier about cleansers than anything else in my entire beauty routine. My skin reacts to too-drying cleansers by overproducing oil and making me break out. On the other hand, while many oil and milky cleansers make my skin feel good, the lack of a deeper clean leaves my skin looking dull. This feels like a miracle. It emulsifies, not foams, on application, and feels so nurturing to the skin. After rinsing off, my skin feels clean and soft. Compared to other milk cleansers, this feels less greasy and more cleaning. The whole process is so enjoyable, I really look forward to doing my skincare routine. Many scents give me a headache, allergic reactions, or skin inflammation. This is the rare instance of a scent that really improves the skincare experience. It smells sweet and light, and doesn’t trigger any sensitives for me.

However, it wasn’t until last week when I actually remembered about it and decided to buy my own. For the past year or so I have had nonstop acne on my cheeks which I’ve been unable to control. The top photos are from May 30th and the bottoms ones are today (June 8th) and ALL my acne is gone from using this product! The only thing I have left is some scaring Which will hopefully fade before too long. For the first time in years I left the house without feeling like I had to cover my face with a hat if I wasn’t wearing makeup! I will say after a week of using this product every day my skin has started to feel very dry around my nose and mouth so going forward I plan on only using this every 3 or 4 days now that it’s done the work getting rid of all my breakouts. Will definitely be buying more from this line!!

It smells and feels exactly like using a bar of soap on your face.

With the exception of Slaai and the sheer Umbra, I have used and loved everything in the line now. That being said the bars are incredible. I love them, much more than Beste which left my skin feeling dry and tight(I still keep beste in the shower, because, waste my precious bars, are you nuts?!) People complain about the bag in this set costing $6 but you only have to buy it once. This was the only option for the bars in my Sephora store, I think everything else is online only. But I am so glad I went for this rather than a backup beste. Now that I have tried them my plan is to buy the full size from now on and maybe I can cut them into quarters? Keep them preserved for longer and keep using quarters, in my $6 bag on the bathroom counter :) Can’t really speak to longevity but they seem barely used, in over two weeks. My skin is so soft and soothed every time I wash my face. I use Juju in the AM and Pekee in the PM. I love the feel and results from both although I liked initially skipping the morning cleanse as DE recommends because it saved time and money lol. Pekee does a decent job removing my makeup. Overall these are worth a try especially if you feel beste dries your skin like me.

It is excellent at keeping my skin from breakouts when combined with a good moisturizer. The reason I am rating this product three stars is that recently the packaging is deplorable. I am unsure as to what they changed, but the adhesive for the shiny silver cap is not strong enough and flakes of silver are coming off onto all my other skincare products, shelves, hands, and even onto my face following a cleansing (I use a silicone pad to exfoliate, but the flakes transfer from my hands onto the pad). I have never had an issue with this product until now. This product could be improved by another dispensing mechanism other than a squeeze tube. I am not a fan of this method of dispensing to begin with, however, I overlooked it due to the product itself being so excellent. I may need to consider other cleanser options in the future if the packaging does not change.

I tried this out in a Sephora Play back a long time ago (apparently it was very early 2018, according to a different reviewer) and loved it. Somewhere along the way I forgot about it, or maybe I didn’t want to drop $30 on a face wash. I savored the sample for a little too long, but even when using the tiniest bit I saw improvement to my skin. This cleanser feels very silky, and tingles subtly. It isn’t painful at all and feels nice. After I use it, my skin just feels clean. It’s literally softer and feels tighter. People are complaining about the smell, but I don’t really mind it. I think it smells a little minty. I am so happy I got a full size after forgetting it existed. I am a college student with dry skin that’s been a little oily after the weird weather. This has been helping tremendously to clear my skin up.

I have acne prone skin as I hit the tender age of 30, and I really needed something that would exfoliate and not be harsh on my skin since I didn’t know what mood swing this new found skin breakout was feeling. I got this along with the cleanse. Both bottles lasted me two and half months. The real problem with these bottles is they are bottle caps and these end up leaking or worse, exploding on your hand when you give a little squeeze. As for my skin, the polish really felt good getting everything off. The cleanse, honestly didn’t do much. Felt like a clean and clear gel face wash. It has sort of this minty like tingling feeling after cleaning which makes you feel like your face is cleaner than it is. I feel like for the price, you can find something that does more for your skin and wouldn’t be so wasteful by the design of the bottle.

Never been writing a review anywhere but it did a magic to my skin so it’s worth saying a couple of words. I’ve always had a problem skin with a lot of acne, enlarged pores and dark spots. Used to go to my cosmetologist every week doing a lot of skin treatments which were helping a little bit but only temporary. Those who have a very problem skin understand how frustrating it is when no matter what you do and how much money you spend your skin still doesnt look good. I decided to give Lancer a try because of a lot of good reviews I saw on it. Have been religiously using this Polish Blemish control together with the cleanser and the nourishing cream and started seeing real changes on my skin within the very first month. I have no acne right now, my pores got barely seen and my dark spots visibly faded. All my friends are telling me that my skin looks so much better now than during the times I was visiting the cosmetologist. I’m very happy with the products and will definitely order more. Don’t hesitate to get the full kit and Caviar Lime Acid Peel as well, it’s worth the price!

I suppose you can use it for both - I splash it on rather than apply it to cotton, and may try it in a spray bottle. I follow with SK II essence, but thinking this might not be necessary. I love the SK II, but is there such a thing as too much of a good thing? I really don't know. All I know is that my skin looks and feels amazing. Now if I could only find my HG eye cream/treatment - something firming that will really help my dark circles. Not sure if such a product exists beyond fillers, but I will continue searching! TL;dr - try this for super soft skin!

The toner is a great refresher in waking up the skin especially as a nursing student. I totally needed a life saver since I do not have time to put on makeup. This helps my skin and keeps it natural and clean all the time. For the days I do put on makeup, it makes my skin glow even more! Got so many compliments with the Benefiance line!!

As I was walking around, I decided to try some of this remover to wipe off my hand. I put a dab on a damp cotton square, and wow, my hand was completely clean after a couple of quick swipes. I bought it immediately and for several months, I used it just as an eye and lip makeup remover in the same fashion--putting a pump on a damp swab and swiping off stubborn makeup. However, I recently started pumping onto my fingers and gently rubbing onto my face directly and the results are even better!! I now use it all over my face by rubbing it straight in and washing off with water. My skin feels amazing afterwards--soft and supple. My mom recently tried it too, on my recommendation, due to her skin feeling dry after makeup wipes, and she is now hooked. This is a fantastic makeup remover, but best of all, it really makes skin feel better after each use.

The previous one had no smell & didn’t leave a residue (I never used to rinse it off) but this one leaves a sticky soapy residue. I guess if you’re looking for a micro water and don’t mind having to rinse it off, this isn’t the worst one but I liked the old formula so much better! Won’t be buying again, super bummed!

Skin Type Combination",4 stars,"I guess Dr. Jart reformulated a much loved formula and I totally get why people are upset because I get how sad it is when I really love something and it's staple in my routine but it's discontinued or changed forever. But as someone who is totally new to this micro water, I thought it was pretty decent in removing eye makeup and foundation compared to other micellar waters I've tried like BioDerma or Caudalie. This smells refreshing and citrusy. I use this as the first step in my triple cleanse. I like to wet two cotton pads with these and then gently push and hold up against my eyes. The trick with micellar water is that if you hold down for 5-10 seconds it will start breaking down hard to wash off makeup. Then swipe (lightly!!) all over face, and proceed to oil cleanser, and then foaming/gel cleanser. Basically, I use micellar water to breakdown hard to wash off make up, I use the oil cleanser to clear the foundation out of my pores, and then I use foaming/gel cleansers to actually wash my face. I remember that once I started doing the korean beauty double/triple cleanse, I noticed a lot less inflammation and acne on my face. I also use this with cotton pads when I wake up in the morning if I don't want to completely wash off all my skincare from the previous night but still want to clear my face from pillow and blanket particles. I have no idea what the old formulation was like, but I do think this has pretty clean ingredients. The bottle is super annoying and finnicky though, there's always a small amount that hangs around and squirts out whenever you try to put the cap back on.

I'm not in the beauty industry and I don't know anyone who works in it, I'm just a huge fan of skincare and makeup with clean, safe ingredients. I have used this product for over 2 years as my exclusive second cleanser (following my oil cleanser which I use if I wear any makeup or sunscreen) and both formulas have been fantastic. Tbh I haven't noticed a real difference between the formulas. The other reviewer who called out that the ingredient list is spot on, if you run the new ingredient list through something like CosDNA and analyze the ingredients, it is extremely clean. It's an incredibly effective cleanser and gets off all makeup residue and most importantly, it doesn't burn your eyes when you're using it to clean off mascara/eyeliner/whatever you've got going on. I've tried 10 of the highest rated micellar waters, from high end to ""all natural"", and Dr Jart is hands down the most effective, has the cleanest ingredient list, and leaves your skin feeling clean without stripping it or leaving a weird residue. This is one of my holy grail products and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

This stuff is amazing, I would say equally as amazing as the old formula, as I have used both and prefer this formula. It’s soft, gentle, doesn’t burn my eyes, smells clean, and lasts a long time.

I do appreciate the large bottle, but the price is a bit hefty considering I don't feel the toner does all that much for my skin. The plus sides are that it smells nice and citrusy, and does pick up the makeup left after my double cleanse. That's really all it does though. I don't notice a brighter complexion or a change in the hydration of my skin. Ah well, still going to finish this bottle.

It states it contains “ 4% by mass of inflammable ingredients” I’ve never used a facial product with either “ingredient” , I definitely am bummed to see fragrance added to it, maybe it’s needed to mask those two items.

Fast forward to now, I have a little bit of a bigger skincare budget. I love this cleanser. It smells heavenly, cleans so well, and helps manage my breakouts. Is it the best gel cleanser I’ve used? Definitely. It lasts me about 9 months- you only need half a pump for your whole face- and I look forward to cleansing every morning and night. But at the end of the day, it is a luxurious gel cleanser. If I had to go on a still strict budget I would spend it on the soft cream and treatment lotion, both which are life changing. If you can afford this cleanser it’s lovely. But it’s not the best of the la mer line if you’re on a budget. I will continue using this as long as I can afford it!

So I started using my foaming cleanser WITH two squirts of the cleansing milk. It turns my tried and true foaming cleanser into a luxurious creamy foam that gets all of my make-up off and adding a little moisture.

Skin Type Combination",4 stars,"I overall really liked this product, it's very hydrating, it literally UNDOES some of my dry patches even better than exfoliation does. I used to have oily skin that, but as I get older, it becomes more combination, so I need a cleanser that will hydrate my skin without triggering my cystic acne, and this product does that. I think the price is reasonable because it lasts a long time, the product going a long way due to its balmy texture. Two important things: you need to use a cleansing oil/makeup remover before using this product. It is not strong enough to get the dirt and grime off your skin without a pre-cleanse. Also, trying to scrub your face aggressively after using the product with only irritate your skin. Wash it off as best you can and then go in with a toner to clean off the rest of the product. The only real problem with this product is that the first time I locked the pump to travel with it, I lost the ability to unlock it again, so now I have to take the tube out to wipe it on my face which isn't sanitary. If you want to travel with this product or don't use a pre-cleanse, you'd probably want another cleanser, but I thoroughly enjoy it, and I'd recommend it to people with combination or dry skin.

I am also slightly on the dry side so i need good toner as the first step to my skincare regiment that will refresh my skin gently. It does have a stronger fragrance but i dont mind it....it disappears once my skin absorbs it! I have been using this for the last few years and it has been keeping my skin refreshed! I've had no incidences with this toner where i break out and etc....It works perfectly for my skintype so i won't be changing my toner anytime soon! I tried Lancome toner, Skin food toner....but i think this Laneige is the best bang for your buck if you aren't too picky.

Normally the sound of toner makes me cringe because my face is dehydrated, but this toner, that I bought a mini-size for travelling, make me want to purchase the full size product soon. What it is: A skin purifying and softening refiner, for normal to dry skin types, to replenish optimal moisture. I agree that this is a solution for: - Dryness - Uneven skin tone - Dullness and uneven texture It does nourishes thirsty skin especially after washing my face. It does leave my skin visibly retexturized and radiant. The glow that this product gives me is so unreal but in a gorgeous way that I'm even using less and less foundation on my skin. I like to use this product on the smooth size of a cotton round because the waffled-size irritates my skin. If you're debating whether to try it or not, I suggest you do! You will be pleasantly surprised.

My skin no longer feels sensitive or irritated, and I’ve noticed that my skin is much more hydrated. I used to get dry patches around my brows and near my mouth and that doesn’t happen anymore. My skin used to be dry but now it’s more “normal”. I love how this toner makes my skin feel. And not only that, but it smells so good and its such a soothing experience applying this to my skin. I’ve only purchased this 4 times in the past year (I lost a brand new bottle of this once). Each time it has lasted me a good couple months! You don’t need to use a whole lot when you apply it. A small quarter sized amount on a cotton pad gets my whole face, neck and chest. If you have dryness and irritation, try this.

It smells wonderful and clean, and feels lovely, refreshing and hydrating on the face, but I find the word “toner” to be a misnomer for this product. This behaves much more like an “essence” — it’s a thick, slightly viscous texture. When I received the bottle, I noticed the usage directions are different from what’s on the Sephora site: the site mentions traditional method of application (ie using a cotton pad) whereas the bottle just says to pat it into your face with your hands..... the way you’d apply an essence! So when I use it, I don’t feel like I’m “toning” — I just feel like I’m adding an extra layer of moisture before my other products, which is not true purpose of a toner. Disappointed as I feel the product is mismarketed — just call it a hydrating essence.

It’s very rich and creamy, and one tube lasts a long time. I use Neutrogena makeup remover cloths and then wash my face with this after and anything the cloths couldn’t remove this gets right out, even waterproof mascara. It works well on its own to remove makeup, I just prefer to keep my wash cloths cleaner longer. The price is also just right! Anytime I find a new skincare product by another brand that I like, I look at their facial cleansers but then immediately think, “I don’t need to try that, what I use now is already perfect!”

Doesn't even specify what kind of alcohol it is which is suspicious. When I first opened the bottle, I can immediately smell the alcohol in it. And when I applied it to my skin, I felt the same moderate, hot, burning sensation as I have with other toners with alcohol in it. I am aware that products with glycolic acid might produce the same temporary ""tingly"", hot, or burning effect as stated in the ""precautions"" above, but I just don't think this product is worth it overall even with a price like this. Stopped after one use so I didn't see much of the difference. And my skin is not even all that sensitive, it leans more towards normal. Will be returning asap. Going to opt for something much more gentle but still does a good job at exfoliating instead.

It’s a great inexpensive way to add an AHA to your skin care routine. My skin texture has definitely gotten better. I love it! The only downside to it is that it ran out pretty quickly. :( i literally got multiple travel sized and sample size products from birthday gifts and things, at the same time i got this, and i ran out of this quicker.

After trying to complete my skincare routine I found that after washing my face it was very oily, this caused me to search for a product to help. When I found this I looked at the reviews and they seemed pretty good so I decided to purchase it. BEST DECISION EVER!! My oily skin GONE. I have seen some reviews that say after applying their skin looks more oily, but you just have to let it really take into effect. It also does not dry my skin which I really enjoy. The only little thing that I would change would be the applicator because when you pour it, it gives a lot, which may be a little bit wasteful of the product. Besides that I LOVE IT!

I also have been trying the 60 second rule (The Golden Rx on YT says you should massaging your cleanser into your skin for a minimum of 60 seconds and/or while singing The Fresh Prince of Belair theme song!) I was using whatever I have left of my old Ceramic Slip for the 60 sec method (which was ok) and also the Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar and Juju Bar (which is hard to describe... it wasn’t totally drying, but it left a kind of “squeak” to my face, which for my dry skin feels like it’s taking away oils I can’t afford to lose). Enter REN. In the evening, I double cleanse (first cleanse is usually Farmacy’s Green balm or Elemis oil balm) and then as my second step, I massage this one in for 60 seconds (or more) and the next day my skin tone is so even! And it keeps away the acne and reduces the appearance of post-acne scarring. I was worried maybe it wasn’t cleaning off my makeup properly, but when I apply toner on with a cotton pad, it’s completely clear. This product is a godsend for my hormonal acne/dry skin.

I’ve had acne since I was 15 (I’m 21 now) but for the past three years, my skin has been more sensitive than ever before. I break out extremely easily and literally every product I use makes the skin above my upper lip irritated for some reason. To say I have sensitive skin is an understatement. I’m talking skin that gets irritated just from washing it with water and no product because the water dries it out. However, out of every cleanser I’ve tried, this one makes my skin react the least. When I first started using it, my skin immediately began to clear up and my redness reduced substantially. I also love the scent. You can definitely smell the clay mixed with the essential oils used in this product. I personally find the scent very calming. Another element I like is the consistency. It’s very creamy and doesn’t strip the oils on my face at all. I barely break out compared to how much I used to. If you are a teen with breakouts or someone suffering from adult acne, I would definitely recommend that you try out this cleanser! It’s reasonably priced and REN aims to be zero waste by 2021, which is a huge reason I chose to purchase from this brand in the first place :) I hope this product helps you as much as it’s helped me!

It's really weird. It also has a strange smell, but I've been able to get past that in hopes that this product would work. After two months I can confidently say this product has not worked for me. It leaves behind what seems like a film of sorts on my face. It also does not cleanse the skin as well as it should. When I do my skincare routine after my shower makeup still comes off onto my cotton rounds. Which is crazy because I remove my makeup with wipes before I even cleanse my face, so really, the facial cleanser just has to be decent to remove the leftover. Otherwise, this has done nothing for my acne. If anything, it's actually made me break out in areas I wouldn't normally break out. It's a no from me.

For many years, I was yo-yoing with different types of toners because it's supposively essentials for acne prone and oily skins. From Proactive to Clinique toners even Lancome. It just doesn't work. It makes my skin rough and drying and thus, breakouts. I hated toners. I wanted to give it another try and maybe this Belif Toner will give better skin results because of the fewer harse ingredients. Unfortunately, no significant result. I finally ran out last week and been thinking to purchase another type of toner. But looking back, my skin feels much smoother and hydrated WITHOUT it. Toner is not necessary and could probably do harm than good for acne skins. I'm finally giving up on toners. It DOES NOT WORK!!! Our skin naturally hydrates and returns to neutral pH level after 15 minutes of washing our face. Toning is useless. My new basic rule: Cleanse, Eye Cream, Serum, Moisturizers, and Protect. That's all you need. Don't waste your time and money on 11 different products layering on top of each one. Stop all the BS.

I've been on antibiotics and topicals for acne for several years now, and now I've stopped using all topical treatments and lowered my antibiotics. I use the wash once a day with only moisturizer after.

At first, I enjoyed the consistency because the thickness made it easy to apply with hands instead of another cotton pad. However, I found it to be a little tacky when I applied it with my hands, more like a cross between an essence and serum instead of a toner. There is definitely more moisture in my skin after a few days, but I'm moving on to a new product once this bottle is done just because the consistency isn't working for me with all of my other products. If you're not using any essences, serums, or ampoules, then I do recommend this, as it does a lot on its own. If you're multi-step like me, you may want a lighter liquid than this.

I've battled oily skin since puberty, and although now I have pretty much conquered that beast, I keep these little helpers in every purse I have for the occasional shine in the T-zone or for when I'm sweating a lot while wearing makeup. I don't ever notice any kind of benefit from the various colors (each has its own active ingredient ie charcoal, green tea, etc.) so for that I subtracted a star. I pick which I get based on my mood while in store.lol I often use both front and back of each sheet until I'm satisfied that I've blotted away the shine or sweat without messing up my makeup. In this Texas heat, that means about four sheets in the middle of the day.

They are thicker sheets compared to others, and my makeup comes off on the papers, so I definitely won't be repurchasing for that specific reason. Also, they smell strange... a little bit vinegary?

Hours later my skin still looked so fresh and the only areas looked less oily. It's the first time I purchase this cleanser and I'm very happy with it.

I had never heard of the brand before & didn’t really know where to start to look for a great anti aging face wash but this IS IT! I was looking for something to target fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone/texture/.. and I truly feel like Saturday Skin does it all. It takes off makeup, it hydrates & plumps skin for a dewy fresh glow. It is gentle enough to use on my one year old, is vegan & you only need a dime size amount at a time. I recommend this to everyone & anyone looking for a vegan, plant based amazing YOUTH RESTORING cleanser. I suggest following with Olenherskin Glow 2O Dark Spot Toner, anti-aging serum of choice & AM/PM moisturizer.

But I stuck with it and began to use it nightly after I ran out of my trusty makeup wipes. This cleanser really gets you clean and removed all of my makeup. I feel so clean, I don’t feel the need to double cleanse as I do with a makeup wipe. I typically use a makeup easer-style cloth to wash off the makeup. I have not yet broken out with this product and my skin doesn’t feel dry or pull after I get done. Once you get over the initial oil and melted makeup look, it will really simplify your nightly routine. I have used nearly the entire bottle. If used regularly, I think a bottle can last between 4-6 months, making it worth your $$

I stopped using it and a few other products and my skin went back to normal within a few days. I have since tested this product twice more without adding or removing any other products to my routine, and each time within 2 days my skin again became very dry and flaky. Each time I took a break from the product, my skin was back to normal within a few days. Effects are consistent whether the product is used once per day or once every other day, indicating to me that either this product is too harsh for sensitive skin, or possibly I am allergic to an ingredient in the product.

Micellar waters just weren't cutting it anymore. To sum it up, it works. It removed my mascara without irritation. What I do to use this is I take a dab on my fingers and message it into my lashes and over my lid to remove any shadow and mascara, then I take a damp tissue and wipe away the melted mascara and excess lotion. I would never leave it without wiping away the lotion but that's my preference. I can't stand oily eyelids and once I wipe it away my eyes are not oily and the mascara is pretty much all gone. I'm very pleased with this and it will probably last forever because I use the tiniest bit every time and there's a lot in the bottle.

As an oil, this seems to have a thicker viscosity and almost feels like a drier oil than most. It doesn’t emulsify much once water is added either. My biggest issue with this cleanser is that it does not remove basic mascara without extra product and extra rubbing, defeating the whole purpose of an oil cleanser removing and melting makeup easily. I’ve never used an oil cleanser that didn’t instantly melt my mascara. Definitely would not repurchase.

I have oily, acne prone skin and everything non-prescription either breaks me out or only marginally works. This stuff WORKS. It takes all my makeup off and it’s so easy to use. I was using micellar water and cotton pads before, and this is so much less waste. Sure it’s a plastic bottle, but it’s also lasted me twice as long as one full size bottle of micellar water + cotton pads. It’s great with taking off foundation and eye makeup, with zero irritation. I’m in love with this product and don’t anticipate using anything else to remove makeup for a long long time.

Skin Type Oily",2 stars,"I am a big fan of cream cleansers, especially during the winter time. I have oily/combo skin so my skin tends to get drier during the colder weather. I’ve used other cream cleansers in the past that I loved but decided to give this one a try because of the major moisture claim. At first, I totally loved this product. My skin felt super soft and moisturized. However, as I used it more, I noticed that I was getting small bumps all over my cheeks and forehead. At first, I just attributed it to hormonal changes but then when I stopped using this cleanser for a few days, the bumps went away. Looking at the ingredients, coconut oil is a primary ingredient in this cleanser which I think was clogging my pores and causing the reaction on my skin. I would say if you’re dry skin, you will really like this product but if you’re oily and/or combo it can potentially be comedogenic on the skin. Also, if you’re not a fan of earthy smells or are sensitive to smells in general, you might not like this cleanser since it has a strong scent.

I took off a star because it is really drying, but my skin is getting used to it, and I am using Retinol as well.

In fact that tingle just tells me it's working. So if you do have sensitive skin just know this product is well formulated, gentle on the skin, and using it every other night is just as effective as using it every night. Just be sure to use sun protection while using this product as it will make you more photosensitive.

Now, I don't feel like it necessarily does anything for my acne other than leave it the heck alone. I get hormonal, often cystic acne flare ups once a month around my mouth and/or jaw line, and this is much nicer at not irritating my skin any further in these areas. I also manage mild to moderate rosacea on my face and eyes. This is where I love this product. It has a lovely cooling effect on my cheeks, which often feel warm during a flare up, and doesn't irritate my skin like the drugstore toners tended to. My sister saw me for the first time since I started using this recently and remarked that my face doesn't look as red as it usually does, so perhaps it is helping with the redness as well! I wish it wasn't so pricey though.

I'd heard good things about the brand so I shelled out the dough for it. It's slightly cooling when you put it on, but I found it made my skin sticky and gross. It also smells like straight up VOMIT. I'm not mincing words here because I think people need to know this before they buy- the smell of this toner makes me sick to my stomach every single time I use it. The smell dissipates fairly quickly, but since it really isn't great on my skin, I just don't think this is worth it. Maybe if I used it every single day for a long time, I'd see some results since it is skincare and it can take time to see a payoff, but with the smell, I can't bring myself to use it.

This cleanser is creamy and develops a really nice texture as you’re working it into your skin. Afterward my skin feels super clean and I can see the difference between this and other cleansers I’ve used- my skin looks brighter and doesn’t get irritated whatsoever by this. My skin is not only sensitive, it’s (cystic) acne prone, dry, and oily!!! This cleanser gives my skin the air it needs to breathe and sets the perfect canvas for absorbing toner / masks / serums / oils, etc. This will definitely be on my repurchase list.

I prefer this over my Dermalogica because there’s less hassle when it comes to application. There’s a ton of product in this, 4oz for $20? That’s amazing. My tried and true makeup remover is from Korres, it’s lighter and doesn’t exfoliate. So I only use this product for heavy makeup days or days where I need to exfoliate dead skin.

You know how well it works because, after cleansing with these, I use my toner and my cotton round is completely clear! Besides them removing every drop of makeup, my favorite thing is, they dry extremely quick!!! Which is great so you're not dealing with moldy particles that can arise on your cloths during the day, before using it again at night, and your makeup rinses out very well after use. I just rinse it will cool water, ring it out and place over my sink or a towel rack. Honestly, there are other brands out there that are cheaper, smaller, and more quantity in a pack. I typically buy two packs every other month then either toss them out or save them for cleaning my dog's eye boogers and ears. ha!

This product tackles that problem easily and still is gentle. I’m new to this brand and wanted to try these cloths as a way to cleanse in the evening and gently remove makeup. I applied my makeup removing balm to my face (I used Clinique Take the Day Off) and used the warm water soaked cloth to remove the thick balm and all traces of makeup. I then rinsed the cloth and washed it thoroughly with liquid hand soap. I hang the towel out and it is dry in the morning. I can stretch the usage out of them with the above mentioned method and avoid having to place the cloth into the machine, but still make sure it is clean. Thick washcloths are too heavy and can scratch the skin. This is nice and thin, but doesn’t have the strange feel of old school white handkerchiefs men still carry around today.

If you have sensitive skin be careful. Also no matter what your skin type is, make sure to apply (and reapply!) sunscreen to your face every single day, even if you're inside. This product will make your skin more sensitive to the sun. With that being said, my skin is pretty strong and my face was clear in two weeks. I was using them every other night the first week, and then every night the second week. I also made sure to put moisturizer on, day and night (even though I have oily skin, just to combat the dryness from the pads). If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test first. Also, try to use them only two or three times a week at first, so your skin has time to get used to it. I'm upset I only ordered one box, I'm buying two boxes right now. These pads and the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic pads are the ONLY ""over-the-counter"" products that have worked to clear my skin.

Just wanted to address some things to the people that aren’t giving these a fighting chance to do their work, and yes these do sting for a minute or two but that’s completely normal. The average time it takes for your skin to completely cycle (cell regeneration) is about a month, so with most products this is why they won’t work immediately, so don’t give up on a product right away! The term “it gets worse before it gets better” is 100% true with all skincare, and any dermatologist will say that (I’ve been to over five and they all say that.) That being said all skin is different and some things might work great for some people, and not so great on others, so listen to your skin! I’m fortunate enough to have dr. Dennis Gross as my dermatologist and he uses his products and prescribes them to me on top of a regular regimen. My skin has never looked better when used with these products in this order: the alpha beta cleanser, alternating between these pads and the clarifying colloidal sulfur mask each night, any prescriptions (epiduo for example), and finishing with the hyaluronic marine oil-free moisture cushion. Hope this helps :)

Before I used this- my acne was horrible. My skin discoloration was noticeable. My skin texture was bumpy, flakey and rough. I researched many types of acne pads before settling on this one. The first time I applied it- there was definitely a tingling and mildly itching sensation but do not be scared - this is simply the product and all the acids within working. I faithfully used it for months and it got rid of ALL my acne. It completely resurfaced and retexturized my skin. I recommended this product to all of my friends and they love it too! Trust me - if you are struggling with acne look no further. This product is the holy grail of acne pads!!! Now I use it a few times weekly for maintenance. I’ll never be without it.

Btw i use heavy acids do pro peels monthly and this burns more than anything I’ve ever put on my face BUT it works even on hormonal acne. I don’t use them all the time bc the experience of putting it on is excruciating but when my skin is really really bad I grab these and use it for a few days and my acne and marks diminish. I cut the pads in half because they are soo saturated and this last me soo long this way it’s so worth the price. Only reason I don’t give it a 5 is because of the itching and burn it’s bad more than a TCA pro peel seriously

The mask does most of the work. After you use it in the morning, and sleep in it over night, use these pads before your moisturizer. I did not peel, nor end up with scarring. I don't know if these pads would work on their own. Either way, I could definitely see the mask working almost immediately. After almost two weeks, all light and deep cystic acne are gone or almost gone.

First of all, I hate the smell of all the MB products they all smell like a really fake botanical perfume and that’s just not my style. Second, this doesn’t work AT ALL with a Clarisonic. I realize it’s not sold as a foaming cleanser but it falls so flat on my Clarisonic I feel like I’m just pushing the brush around my face. I think it might be helping me recover from a hormonal breakout — I can’t tell if my skin is just balancing out after my body being back to normal (until next month) or if this has helped or at least speed that process up. TLDR: I’m not going to buy this again, especially because of the strong fragrance that I don’t like.

When it lathers it feels nice, however as I rinse it off, it’s hard to do that gently without feeling like my hands are dragging on my face. Then, I’d notice my face would have slight redness and a bit of stinging around the lower half of my face. After a few uses, the same thing would happen but I started noticing tiny bumps around my chin and jawline (I only break out on my cheeks and forehead), also my pores never looked clean. Today I used a standard CeraVe cleanser and my jawline is already starting to feel normal again. I wanted to like this considering it’s $26 and “natural” but NOPE. I’ll be returning it. The one star is just because it smells nice, but fragrance is no helper either.

You can spray it on a cotton round or your palms and pat it gently into your skin if you want to preserve as much product as possible or spray directly onto your face.

The scent (although I prefer fragrance-free), which is a blend of neroli and rose, is so light, and was surprisingly inoffensive. I usually go for sweeter, fruitier scents. The mister is perfect, no little spurts of liquid gathering at one spot. It helped tone and balance my skin, while keeping it moisturized. I typically use this after moisturizer, makeup-free.

Not everyone's skin will react the same but stick with it at least a week or 2 before deciding if it really works for you. You can definitely feel the enzymes working and for those with sensitive skin it may sting a tiny bit in some areas but once you rinse your skin will feel incredibly smooth!

My skin is so smooth, soft and clear. It does have a bit of a smell to it compared to Daily Micro, but I don't even notice it at this point. I will say if you have really sensitive skin and you are stuck between picking Daily Microfoliant and Daily Superfoliant, Daily Microfoliant is probably going to be the one you prefer.

I purchased this because the description intrigued me as it claims to not only hydrate but protect your skin. I’m not a skin expert but I definitely agree with the claims. My skin was instantly hydrated, I can’t stand when my face feels dry or even remotely taut. In addition, it wasn’t a temporary feeling, rather I felt the hydration last all day. Some days it’s windy and dirt sometimes hits my face (gross I know) especially since I enjoy walking outdoors a lot, and my face isn’t as nasty when I wash it off in the evening. Not sure how true that is but I’m so in love with this toner that I believe it lol. Anyways I usually apply this with a cotton pad but it seems I’m almost halfway done in about 2 months unfortunately, though I could be applying more than the average person. I love the fact it’s a clean product, yet effective. I also want to attribute my recent confidence boost in less make-up days to this product (as well as the new Sephora vitamin C serum and moisturizer) because my skin has been looking so clear and even in skin tone.

This was a definitive step up from that product. I noticed an immediate improvement the very next morning after using this cleanser and over the course of the next two days it only got better. My skin was plump and smooth, the lines around my mouth faded dramatically and the redness in my cheeks had diminished noticeably. And it didn't hurt my eyes at all which was very important to me. I don't proclaim this as a panacea but it's definitely doing its job. I will be more than happy to keep using this product even if it is a little more expensive.

I noticed a difference in my skin tone after just a few days of using and I even recommended it to my friend with rosacea.

I have even gone back to come moisturizers that I thought were irritating me but turns out it was my other face washes causing the irritation. Its amazing to see how much a good cleanser can do to you skin compared to harsh detergent filled foaming cleansers. I dont wear makeup, but when I wear SPF I use a fragrance free oil cleanser first because I am not sure this would be strong enough to remove the SPF. So for anyone reading this who wears make up or SPF, this is the perfect face wash for the morning when you don't have much to remove and in the evening if you double cleanse.

This cleanser probably won't remove heavy/longwear makeup (and definitely not eye makeup, in my experience), but it's the perfect cleanser to finish up with after makeup remover. And unlike most cleansers, some of the beneficial ingredients ""stay"" on your skin, so the price is fair in my opinion (I usually don't pay a lot for cleansers since they wash off anyway...).

This stuff definitely mattifies, and it feels absolutely wonderful on application, but it dries down to a strange tacky film. While it did reduce my pores, it also filled them with a matte gray dot, making me look like I was about to do mo-cap for the world's most detailed video game character. Definitely not my best look, and when I applied serum and moisturizer, it all smeared together into this really weird top of skin mess. My makeup sat weird, and my face felt stiff. Yes, I thoroughly shook it up first, and I even tried applying, then wiping once over with a clean cotton ball to remove excess film. All that did was remove the mattifying effect while leaving behind the horrendous gray dots. This will be a return.

I wasn’t sure about buying this one because I usually go for toners that feel clean and cleansing and the thought of putting what looked like dirt on my skin was not something I necessarily wanted. However, I needed a new toner and all the other timers I had tried would irritate my sensitive skin. I had also used the Fresh Rose toner, but that didn’t clean enough (story of my life). The non-alcohol toners I tried would not clean good enough and the alcohol toners would dry out my skin. So I have this a shot. And from DAY ONE my skin looked amazing, my make up stayed on all day and my pores were minimized to almost the invisible. I have never been able to wear make up for a whole day before using this toner and now, now my make up stays on the whole day. Even with my oily skin. Try it. You won’t regret it.

After doing some research I decided to look for a toner with no alcohol in it. I also wanted to find a toner that didn't contain any oils (oils ALWAYS end up inevitably breaking out my sensitive/oily skin). Searching for these two things led me to this toner, and let me tell you, I could not be happier that it did! The second I put this toner on it felt like my skin took a nice long cool drink of water it so desperately needed. My skin immediately felt smoother and plump. After a few days of using this toner my skin started clearing up, and what acne is left is significantly reduced and less red. This is the first time I've ever tried an Algenist product and I have to say I am very impressed and will be repurchasing, and also exploring their full line!

So if anyone comes out with an Essence, toner, retinol, and vitamin C, moisturizer, and sunscreen in one I’ll be the first in line to try it! ;) So while I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin appearance, I haven’t broken out or had any unusual reactions and it saves me a step so I’ll probably keep using it.

The only problem I have is with the packaging. It is designed to keep the product from flowing freely. Therefor, you have to shake the bottle to get the product out. This is a serious design flaw since most are usually trying to get the product onto a cotton ball or cotton pad. A lot of product gets needlessly wasted because of this.

It hasn’t helped with clearing out my acne but it hasn’t caused me to break out either. I have sensitive skin and some of the other clear start products have irritated my skin but this one hasn’t so that was a plus. So far all of the clear start products I have tested out (including this one) have this interesting smell where I can’t decide if I like it or hate it. Regardless, I think it’s an average face wash. I didn’t feel that it completely cleansed my face like other face washes out there but it’s not completely horrible.

Trouble is, my skin is highly reactive so I often end up with a rash about 2 weeks after starting a product. This cleanser is one I turn to when my skin is in that state. It doesn't worsen the reaction/rash/ eczema or whatever state it's in and it may even soothe the situation a bit. I don't feel like it does much more than that (not that that's a small thing), though. It claims to brighten and exfoliate as well as help with uneven texture. I don't feel like it does any of that. It looks a bit shiny when you squeeze it out of the tube, but that's as close as it gets to brightening. A good thing to have when my skin gets angry, but I'm looking for more in a cleanser.

I’ve used it a few times now, and each time I had to get out of the shower to get a different one that actually works. The grains are large, and there’s just not nearly enough of them. Feels like trying to exfoliate with a pinch of sand mixed in a tablespoon of smelly gel. (That smell- very old lady, very strong. But it dissipates really fast.) I tried using this as a second exfoliator, essentially an in-shower moisturizer, but that made my skin bright red- either irritated by the fragrance on fresh skin, or by the random grains which make it hard not to scratch yourself. The only thing is that it IS moisturizing. I’ve tried other moisturizing exfoliators, and this one is far far better at the moisturizing part. Given the price and the ineffectiveness, it’s hard to recommend this at all, but possibly it would be an ok choice for someone who has such dry skin that they can’t make it from rinse-off to moisturizer. For everyone else, I’d suggest using a more effective scrub (there are so many) and a good moisturizer.

After first use my face was instantly silky smooth and glowy(before I applied any serums or creams). The consistency is on the thicker side and you def feel the salt and sugar in the mix. It’s not too abrasive to my dry, sensitive skin. But enough to give a fresh look and feel .Using it on damp skin will give more of an exfoliant effect, vs wetting it before applied, causing the product to be more creamy and more polishing (gentle). My only complaint is the smell it’s not classic lamer but with the ingredients in this product it’s a small price to pay up for the results. Packaging is heavy standard lamer, price for product is also as expected with this brand. I find using this product paired with the regenerating or hydrating serum vs the contour serum works best to give an extra hydrating effect. ( then lamer soft cream).

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"Great mixture of an oil and scrub/exfoliant. Not to harsh and it didn’t leave my skin feeling stripped and dry. Instead, it was left smooth and hydrated. This reminds me of Fresh Sugar Face Polish as far as the mixture of oils mixed with the light texture of scrub. I compared them both and this one did leave my skin a bit more hydrated and smooth, probably because it has more oil in it. If you’re a skincare product connoisseur like myself, and don’t mind splurging a bit, I would highly recommend this scrub, as it is GREAT! If you are just looking for an every other day or once a week Scrub that won’t dry you out or leave your skin stripped, I’ll suggest going for the smaller size Fresh Sugar Face Polish, it smells better, it won’t put a dent in your wallet, and it is neck and neck compared to this.

However, this is an awesome product in itself- I wouldn’t say it is a good replacement for the refining facial as this is oil based and the other is clay based- but it’s still amazing nonetheless. This makes my pores nonexistent and my skin is so soft immediately after using it. I supplement this with the la mer foaming cleanser and then follow with the Koh Gen Do oriental plants lotion, if I have time. If not, I just go straight to a serum (either the Mila Moursi lifting serum or the La Mer regenerating serum) and then the La Mer soft cream. This regimen has made my pores disappear, my skin is now glowing and hydrated, and compexion is even. My skin is literally flawless and I’m so glad to have found a worthwhile addition to my skincare ritual.

You don't need to use a lot either, I use less then a pump and gently applying little to no pressure massage the oil with my fingers over my face and eyes then wipe it off with a wet microfiber face towel, and all of the makeup is gone!

I’ve probably bought five or six different oil cleansers before this one and there’s usually a *little* more substance to them. I’m also going thru this super fast. I only use one pump but I guess the bottle dispenses a lot in one pump - also probably because of that “thinness” I mentioned. BUT, it works and it smells wonderful and looks elegant on your sink.

I was very skeptical of the AmorePacific line because of how fragranced their products are but fell in love and bought full sizes of many products after trying some deluxe samples. This cleansing oil is the first cleansing oil that I've actually enjoyed using and did not irritate my eyes despite the scent (I actually open them mid-way through cleansing to check that all the eye makeup has dissolved esp on my under eye lol). I follow up with their foam cleanser. YMMV, esp since it's fragranced, definitely try before you buy since their samples are often available on Sephora. I personally like the scent of their products, reminds me a bit of Chanel Allure which is what I use regularly.

When the cleansing oil I used to use became unavailable except for online, I began an adventure to find something comparable and was so disappointed in various lines. The oil was either too slick/watery or too heavy and difficult to move around my face. I also didn't trust any that asked you to wet your hands or face before using since that's counterproductive in using a cleansing oil. Only rinse with water. Enter AmorePacific! When I bought the treatment cleanser, I also decided to grab the cleansing oil. It's the perfect consistency for easy massaging into the face and delicate eye area. It works as well, if not better, than the one I used for so many years before. My skin always feels so fresh and clean after using this, and I sometimes don't even want to follow up with the treatment cleanser because I know my makeup is off, and there's no film or residue.

I’ve been using it 2-3x a week on my 30+ year old skin for quite awhile. It is not an effective exfoliator and it doesn’t brighten anything. It lacks the acid content to give a good chemical exfoliation and it lacks in physical exfoliators. Some reviews say this scrub is abrasive, but if there’s no chemical exfoliants to do the job then you need something?? I think I keep using this product at this point because I feel bad throwing it out.

I cant start the day without moisturizing my skin, if I don't it feels tight and leathery. I put this on in replace to my moisturizer for the day as I was running late for work and it worked perfect had no problems. I break out very easy if I use new products so I was hesitant to buy this but when I got matched for my foundation a few weeks back the gal put this on my face. I really liked it a lot, it was light weight and I noticed my face didn't spaz out. After this one I might try to others to see which one I like better. I did noticed my face was smoother and more glow like and my dark spots/redness seemed lighter . I think the only con to this is that they should come up with an applier for this. I just get little pads or fluff balls and those do the trick too! This picture is me this morning after I put it on-without makeup just mascara, feels nice and fresh! I struggle with dark spots and my former acne aftermath and this stuff works great :)!

Then I went back to the instructions and realized I have to add water to emulsify. This is when I saw it work its magic. I could the colour of my tinted moisturizer mixing with the cleanser and I assume it was also taking off the SPF which I apply on top of my tinted moisturizer. I think this product did a good job at taking everything off of my face. The only drawback I experienced was that my face felt like it had some oily residue after I washed everything off with water. Since I was paranoid that this could cause me to breakout (has happened before with products leaving oily film on face), I ended up using another REN cleanser to take it off. After the double cleanse, my skin felt great! Squeaky clean and hydrated! Recommend if you're into double cleansing

I did have to rub almost into my eyes to remove my liner but that's probably because of how close to my eyes I apply it. It didn't burn or irritate my eyes at all. I have super sensitive skin and this left my skin feeling smooth, clean, and not at all irritated. I didn't follow with another cleanser but I could see wanting to if you felt your face was extra dirty that day.

I used this to remove my eye makeup, and it removed everything from shadow, liner, to mascara. I didnt like that when i washed off the eye makeup, it kind of spread over my face, but maybe that's just a matter of me needing to learn how to wash off eye makeup more carefully? I don't wear full face makeup, so the eye makeup spreading was kind of annoying, but again, it did succeed in removing all the makeup. Im that instance, I followed up the wash with another Ren cleanser. I then used this product to wash my face after having SPF on (no eye makeup) and again, it did a good job of cleansing my face. I did not follow that up with another cleanser, and my face did feel nice and clean. Its not instant love with this product, but it definitely cleanses. I'lll be experimenting with it more to see if it grows on me. I have sensitive skin and all was well in that regard, no bad reactions... I would suggest giving it a try, and most definitely if you wear full face makeup, itll get your face nice and clean of product.

I did find that I needed more product than I anticipated to cleanse my face. Once I used a generous quarter sized amount, it worked great. This did need time upon application to remove all my makeup; it’s not an apply-and-rinse-off-immediately type of cleanser. Massaging it into my skin for a minute, and then adding water to change it to milk consistency, worked best. It has a slight scent, reminded me of candy. But the scent dissipated upon use and is very mild. My face is dry and easily irritated, and this cleanser left it feeling moisturized and soft and did not cause irritation or breakouts. I will definitely be using this again.

This toner has been the only thing that's worked nicely with all of my products to keep my cystic acne away and not contain my two big allergy ingredients (rose and aloe). It doesn't sting and I follow it up with COSRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid. If I don't use them together, it doesn't work at all. One without the other? Cystic acne immediately. Really I just got rid of one on my nose because I didn't pay attention. Since acne can depend on a lot of circumstances, spot treat this first and know what your acne is being caused by.

And I know it was the toner because it was the only thing in my routine that changed. It's also fairly drying, and smells a bit like rubbing alcohol. It's a bit deceptive because after using it your face looks really nice and it minimizes your pores, but it's really just slicked away every drop of moisture left after cleansing. I've used both of the toners Laneige sells, and I did not have the same problems with the other one. I know alcohol is one of the main ingredients in both, but their other toner didn't feel as drying, nor did it cause any breakouts. I have combination skin, which both claim to work for. I'm not sure why this particular toner caused so many problems for me.

I bought a 7 day trial pack that had 7 of these packets and a booster serum thing that you mix yourself and it only lasts 7 days, because it is that fresh and goes bad after 7 days. Anyways, the powder cleansing packets won over me almost right away. I noticed my skin feeling and looking slightly more radiant in a couple days. By the end of 7 days I was sold and absolutely hooked. As for the 7 day serum thing, I am not so sure about it. It didn't impress me enough to buy more of it. I did end up using it for 9 days. There was product left over and I was not about to throw it out! Use by dates are guidelines, right?... Anyways, my face didn't turn into a pumpkin or anything, but I also didn't come out of my 7 days with the serum looking like Gigi Hadid. People tell me I have high expectations. I am now back buying the second supply of these powder cleansers. I use it only in the morning. I wet my face and rub the content of one packet in. It lathers really well! I don't wash it off yet, I leave it on while I brush my teeth. Those dreadful two minutes, man... at least it makes me happy thinking that I am getting two things done during that boring time. Then I wash it all off and ta da... I am all fresh and rejuvenated! You can also do what my mother does and use only half of the packet and save the other half for the next day. She swears by it.

I started incorporating micellar water into my routine, just one I bought from the drugstore, but after reading up on some of the ingredients I wanted to switch to a cleaner product. I tried Caudalie, I love a lot of their products but it left my skin with a weird tacky residue...I returned and tried this and it’s amazing! No residue, just give a minute to fully dry before doing the next step in your routine. It does an excellent job cleansing, I often use it on it’s own instead of double cleansing, and I have oily skin!! And it fully cleans my skin, not as great for removing a full face of makeup- not because it doesn’t do the job, but you need several cotton pads to get everything off, and it’s a little pricey for the amount you get so I only use for light makeup days.

I felt that i had to over compensate in serums and moisturizers. I think if youre looking for an effective glycolic wash, talk to your dermatologist for their recommendation that doesnt contain SLS. You can also just use a regular SLS-free fash wash (drugstore brands!) and then apply an chemical exfoliant after for better results.

At first I didn’t read on the label it was only supposed to be used 2-3 a week so I used it every morning and night and was surprised after reading reviews that nothing had happened worsened from doing that. I was in love with it when I noticed it would clear up my chin acne, however I would continue to get flare ups (and I’m not sure if that’s just my crappy chin or irritation from the product and thats the only reason why i gave 4 stars not 5). It may be too harsh for me everyday, but I started alternating with CeraVe and it works great. I will say this product did an amazing job of improving my skin tone, evenness, and pore size and no cleanser has ever made my skin look this great. (I also pair with a calming toner and the Say Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer and it makes my oily skin feel hydrated and has improved its ~oiliness~ a lot!)

As a Master Esthetician while analyzing my clients skincare regimens, I kept hearing this brand being mentioned as some of my clients go to. Mainly their cleansers and toners, which yes I believe that the right or wrong cleanser/toner may or may not set the tone for your skin’s PH and some other factors but I’ll spare the long details here. Let’s get into this cleanser.. •It has a light lemon scent. The smell doesn’t linger on the skin or isn’t overwhelming •It’s a light watery/gel texture •It has a nice lather and if you like that squeaky clean feel, this definitely does that! While it did leave me a little dry, and tight afterwards, which was expected from this particular type of cleanser given the instructions, (so dry skin beware) it also cleared some hyperpigmentation and smoothed out some in-grown hair follicles I deal with. •It’s a great Treatment Cleanser, with glycolic acid being the active ingredient in this, and high up in the ingredient list. •It’s budget friendly. You get a 6oz bottle, which is bigger than the average size regular cleansers that don’t have any active ingredients in them for $16! A little bit goes a long way, as you only should use this 1-2 times a week. Therefore, this will last you a good while, so you’ll definitely get your moneys worth! In conclusion, I’m surprised how much I enjoy this cleanser and would definitely recommend it to the budget conscious skincare rookie, the spend all skincare connoisseur, and mostly combination/ problematic skin types, dry, and oily skin types.

My makeup routine is always like this primer, cushion foundation, blush, a little bit of conturing powder for my nose, eyebrow powder. I wear lash extensions so I don’t really wear eye makeup. This micellar water takes all my makeup off by using 2 cotton pads. There is no need to really soak the pads for me but gotta get them wet enough. I try to take off eye makeup sometime but it takes more to remove all the colors and waterproof eyeliner. Also, I can see my skin is improving. At first, I was afraid that only using this without washing my face with face wash would break me out. Oh boy! I was wrong. This little friend is amazing for those who would get lazy at night after a long day like me. It can take off everything without rinsing. After I use this, I apply toner with cotton pad and there is no residue on the pad. It’s really cool. It’s on a pricier side for a makeup remover without rinsing so I just take one star off.

I've been using it for 4 years and it's the only cleanser I found in the market that works for me and I've tried almost everything. Now that they changed the formula with this Multi Deep Cleanser, I can no longer use it because it does not clean well as the other one and doesn't leave my skin feeling fresh and squeaky clean. Also it leaves my face oily unlike the other one, my face was not oily nor dry and I have a combination skin so I don't know what they added/removed to this cleanser that it doesn't have the same effect as the Multi Cleanser. I'm so disappointed of Laneige because it's a Korean brand and most Korea products works really well. I really hope they bring the Multi Cleanser back or I'll have to look for a different cleanser to use since this one is no longer working for me.

5690,FateAsAlways,5 stars,"I purchased this back in early Feb (2015), after trying too many makeup removed. Even several different facial cleansing wipes. I was skeptical at first, but boosted by the positive reviews. After the first use, I was bubbling over with happiness! I followed the instructions, shook it until the solution emulsified, squeezed it onto my cotton swipe pad and placed it on my closed eye. I let it sit a few moments abd looked at the pad, thrilled to see how much of my waterproof eyeliner and mascara had come off, already! I repeated, this time jiggling a little to move my eyelashes, then becoming bold and actually wiping. That first time I used one cotton pad per eye. Now, I can do this with just one pad for both. It's perfect! Now I can wash my face without the worry of leftover black streaks and leaving makeup on my hand towels! It does leave an oily film afterwards, so you really do want to wash your face as normal afterwards. I became ill and was too exhausted to wash my face. The oily film was still there in the morning. I ended up using a facial wipe instead and a toner. I also suffer from cystic acne (I am in my mid thirties, so beyond teen hormones lol), not fun, and this hasn't affected any of the breaks as of yet. Especially since I finally have them under control. I was worried about that, too. I wish they did sell a larger bottle, but then my arm would probably fall off from trying to emulsify it! I did try to give it 5 stars, but it only allowed my giving it four. ***** So here's it's true trading from me! And I'm actually prepping for the near future and buying my 2nd bottle today. Though I won't need it for another ... 3 weeks, month at most, I'm thinking. I very highly recommend it, especially for those of us with acne AND sensitive skin! ,

Right now I'm using the Benefit They're Real remover and I have to really work it in, which means a lot of rubbing. When I tried this i used a nice cotton pad, let the product sit on my eyes for a few seconds then gently wiped away once. It got 90% off. I was amazed. A few more gentle wipes was all I needed. Then I flipped and did the same on the other side. Now this isn't on waterproof makeup but I don't use it often. Worked on my Dior mascara and Bare Minerals shadows like a dream. Falling in love with this brand.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"I was searching for a cleanser that left my normal to dry skin more hydrated yet still adequately clean. A Sephora employee brought this product to my attention and I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did! The consistency is creamy and it does lather up slightly, but the best part is, when I rinse my face, it is beautifully soft and clean. I personally am not a huge fan of the scent but it’s not overly potent, I don’t mind it because it works that well! The packaging is very plain which makes it easy to look past it, but it is truly a diamond in the rough because it actually works! If you have dry or sensitive skin and are tired of cleansers sucking out your skin’s hydration, give this product a try!

Skin Type Normal",1 star,"This smells awful. I don’t normally complain about a product’s smell, but this one takes the cake. I don’t like the feel of it while using it and it makes my skin feel dry. Even my hands are dry after using it. This is getting returned after just two uses.",https://www.sephora.com/product/gentle-rejuvenating-cleanser-P296413?icid2=products%20grid:p296413
