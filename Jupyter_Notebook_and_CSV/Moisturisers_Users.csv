I bought the big bottle and haven’t looked back since, now this is the only cleanser I’ll use. I used to get little pimples all over my forehead and ever since I started using this (a year ago) they went away and haven’t returned. While I can’t speak for everyone’s skin, this was a miracle product for clearing my complexion and soothes my facial redness each time I use it. Im in love.

Finally i couldn’t take it anymore, I stopped using it, went back to my cerave hydrating cleanser- and Bam! My skin was clearing up every day after that. I suggest getting the small bottle to try it out first. Remember everyone’s skin is very different.

(A quick google search of any brand will tell you if they're actually cruelty-free, don't just trust what a company says on its site, there are very loose rules about a company being able to claim they're CF on their marketing material) I use Farmacy Green Clean to thoroughly remove all my make-up before using this, if you wear long wear makeup you may want to do the same. I follow with their Dream Mask at night and Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream or YTTP Adaptogen Cream in the am. I recently moved to Chicago from California and my newly dry winter skin is happy once again :)

I have many of their products arriving in a few days to begin updating my skincare regime, and I was about to include this product in that order. However, upon further inspection of the ingredient list, Rosa damascena flower water is listed as the third ingredient!!!! This is a highly irritating fragrance and for people with sensitive skin such as myself is an ingredient that should be avoided. If they choose to reformulate without this and the other fragrances in the toner, I would be happy to try it out. But a bottle with probably close to 5 percent fragrances? That is not beneficial to the skin, let alone for a leave on product. :/

Recently, I started using retinol and wanted to try a new face cleanser because my was drying my skin even more after using retinol. I don’t understand how this product can have such a high rating. Before using it, I decided to read the list of the ingredients and several of them are carcinogenic or may be carcinogenic (Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Disodium EDTA, ...). I don’t how good of a skin product it is as I haven’t even used it, but based on the list of the ingredients it is not a safe beauty product.

I’ve tried prescription topicals, diets, supplements, a myriad of face washes, skincare systems and spot treatments, adapalene, etc. I’ve tried almost everything. I think the issue is that my skin is not at all oily, but instead is dry and sensitive, so most acne products just make it worse. Then I found SKII. In combination with Shiseido Ultimune, used daily for about 3 months, I’ve noticed an improvement in texture/scarring, discoloration and dryness. My skin responds to almost nothing, so for there to be a visible change at all is incredible. I think it’s the fungi that are in both products, honestly. I highly recommend this if your skin is sensitive, aging acne prone. If nothing else works, try this. I feel like people who are blessed with naturally clear and generally balanced complexions may not notice much of change, but for those of us that continually struggle this is a godsend.

There is a slightly fermented smell that is intolerable to some, but honestly fades within moments of application. It has a watery consistency and did keep my skin feeling soft and balanced over the years, always ready for my serums and moisturizers. However, the reason why I am discontinuing my usage of this product and only giving it 3 stars is that it is simply too expensive for what it is. The main and honestly only noteworthy ingredient in this product is pitera, which is a fermented product of yeast, with proven benefits to the skin (from limited research that was conducted by the company that owns SK-ii). And that's it. At less than half this price point, you can find all kinds of Korean and Japanese essences and toners that are packed full of other goodies like antioxidants, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is a great product! But after having used it for all these years, I do not think it is worth the luxury price tag. But if you do find yourself loving pitera, I would recommend that you turn to the SK-ii facial clear lotion toner, as there are additional AHAs in there (in addition to the pitera) to make the price tag more worthwhile.

I woke up the next morning with a much better looking face. It was smoother, less red, and majority of my pimples were gone. It is different than other scrubs I have used in the past, since you put it on dry skin, and then wipe off with warm water. I’ve also never used an enzyme scrub before but I love it. It also smells nice too. When I put it on for the very first time and took it off I did notice my skin was a little irritated and red by my cheek bones. I have sensitive skin and was worried that this would be the first and last time I got to use this product, but I’m so glad it wasn’t! Since then I have been running a little less in that area and I’m not having any problems with skin irritation. The only problem I’m having is limiting myself to using it only twice a week!

It's a scrub with a gentle peel for your face 1-2 times a week. absolutely loved the idea of pineapple and papaya enzymes as a scrub. I use pineapple for everything, health wise, so why not on my face. My skin immediately looked brighter and felt smoother after I rinsed all of the ""gunk"" off. My face was instantly radiant. I even got compliments from my household members about my glowing appearance. I officially turned them onto it. It's interesting because you always look for scrubs that give you the ""appearance"" of glowing skin, but this one actually does the job. I even decided to try it on my lips just to see if it would work and it did flawlessly, removing dead skin and making my lips smooth and kissable. For this price point and a little going a long way, this scrub is well worth the money. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind spending a pretty penny or a great scrub.

I would describe the “scrub” part as very small micro beads so it leaves the skin feeling very smooth. I have sensitive skin and it does not leave me red or irritated. When using this product, I noticed that it was definitely removing dead skin cells as I could actually see them clumping up. At first, I thought something was wrong but then I realized it was actually dead skin cells! Once I washed my face, I was left with a matte smooth surface. You absolutely need to moisturize after using this. I would have given it five stars if it smelled like pineapples.

I’ve been using the hemp wipes at night when I’m too lazy to do anything else, even skipping moisturizer, and they leave my face really soft and clean in the morning with no dryness. For any of these, if you’re removing a lot of makeup and mascara, you may need two wipes to effectively clean. Definitely would recommend any of the ones I’ve tried with hemp being the best in my opinion. Trying grapefruit and papaya next probably.

It’s so gentle and gives your skin a great clean and very spa like experience, yet I don’t feel like my skin is stripped or dry after. The little beads are so gentle and you can barely feel them. I really have noticed a difference in the amount of blackheads around my noise and my pores seem smaller(which I know they can’t actually get smaller, but maybe less clogged). Highly recommend trying this if you have combo/ oily skin and are break out prone. I think sensitive skin and reactive skin would also love this because my skin will breakout in bumps or a rash and even acne if it does not like a product I put on it.

It took me a little while to want to use it since I had used another Drunk Elephant product that my skin did not like. I went on a trip, which normally causes me to break out. I took this mini with me for convenience. I ended up not breaking out at all. Not even a little bit. When I got home, I kept using the mini alternately with my Boscia cleanser. My skin looked and felt great. I ended up ordering a full size. I still use it alternately with my other cleanser. I like how soft my face feels after I use this cleanser. It seems pretty gentle, so if you have sensitive skin, this might be a worthwhile try.

I find other physical exfoliants use products like walnut shells and coffee groundings - which do not grind to the same sizes AND do not break down with water. This can be very dangerous when your just scrubbing your face with it and if your anyone like me you go to town with exfoliants. This rice powder is gentle, safe and gets the job done. It’s well worth the price point because since it comes as a powder it lasts longer than you think as you use so little compared to a gel physical exfoliant! My favorite tatcha product!

Stayed with it because my extremely sensitive skin (break out prone, dry, etc) was happy with it. And it does a good job of cleansing without drying out. This is scent free but it does get slightly foamy/sudsy if that is a thing for you. Tip -- buy the mini. The large lasts so long (even with using on my face, neck, decolletage and back) that by the time I reach the end of the big tube mildew starts to form around the cap.... ew. No such issues with the smaller size. Value per ounce is about the same so I just buy 2 mini tubes at a time instead. Due to the sudsiness, I have now switched mainly to the YTP Superfood Cleanser.

As a bonus, the scent of this Super Amino cleanser is so refreshing and relaxing, it’s perfect both at night and in the morning! I think the best way to use this product in your morning routine would be washing with 2-3 pumps, applying a nice layer of the CC serum, and topping it off with sunscreen.

This bottle is beautiful glass and is recyclable through Summer Friday's recycling program (see their site). The pump works well and 3-4 pumps is more then enough product for cleansing. While cleansers can be great at removing make up, double cleansing is always where you'll see the best results. If you wear a full on foundation and contoured face it would be in in your best interest to use an oil based cleansing product prior to allow this amazing cleanser to work it's magic on your skin! This gel cleanser is light on foaming up meaning it won't strip your skin of natural oils. The scent is light and pleasant, not at all over powering.

That being said, this toner along with OLEHENRIKSEN face wash are now staples in my daily skincare because of affordability and quality. I do splurge on skincare, but this is one of my MUST-HAVES.

In all honesty, I was kind of skeptical trying this at first because I’ve never tried an exfoliant like this before. It is very unique as a half teaspoon of this rice powder is supposed to get poured into your wet hand, and then rubbed together with your other hand to form a paste. I had doubts that it would lather, but it did, and more importantly felt great on my face. The powder itself was mostly powder with minuscule grainy pieces of rice, I am assuming. The grit itself was very fine though and did not feel rough on my face. I can see why this can be used on a daily basis. Ultimately, I really liked this product and would buy it. It felt very calming to my skin and my skin felt super smooth afterwards, which is great because the cold weather has left my skin chapped and peeling in various spots on my face before using this product.

I really like this exfoliant because the beads are micro and not too big like some others that I have tried, it’s like a powder. Because of this, it is not too abrasive on the skin but gentle enough to use every day. I use it about twice a week because I also use a chemical exfoliant, and using it daily would be too much for my skin. I also love the ingredients, like salicylic acid, rice enzymes, White tea and licorice for brightening, and oatmeal and Allantoin to calm the skin. If you like a physical exfoliant and you haven’t tried the micro exfoliant, I would definitely recommend this one. I just put my daughter on to this exfoliant because she has dry skin and it’s been peeling a lot lately. One bottle lasts for months.

I saw all the reviews about your face feeling so so soft, but didn't believe it until I tried it! It's hard to explain, but it's so true. My face felt very clean afterwards as well. My only problem is that my face was extremely sensitive after I tried it (I used it correctly) and every product that normally doesn't hurt my face was stinging and I had to put my face in front of a fan until the stinging subsided. My face is also sensitive due to using tretinoin (2 months in) so if you are using strong topicals, I wouldn't suggest using this until your face is more ""normal"" and not as easily irritated. Definitely going to try using again later on, but I wanted to warn anyone who is possibly in the same situation.

I'm fair with dry skin, but can break out with many cleansers of which I've tried them all, from gels to lotions to cleansing oils, but most either break me out or leave my skin feeling dry and stripped. After 5 days of the Squalane Cleanser, it has not caused any congestion and it leaves my skin feeling healthy. Some reviews didn't find it easy to use, but it hasn't been a problem for me. I use a nickel sized amount and rub it all over my dry face (you don't wet it first) and just keep lightly rubbing it all over until it becomes like an oil. I then rinse with water or use an Aveda shammy to remove the product. I'm thrilled with this. If you have dry, sensitive skin- you have found the perfect cleanser.

This works perfect to break the make up on my face down and prepare my face for another cleanser. You can’t cleanse and remove make up in one step, it just doesn’t work. This doesn’t irritate my eyes when I rub off my mascara and it’s so gentle. This product is better for the environment than a make up wipe but does the same removal job.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"I do not use makeup wipes on my face. So double cleansing has become a staple in my skincare routine. Double cleansing is better for your skin and the environment, so it's a win-win situation. I enjoy using balms as well as cleansing oils for the first step. I like to rotate because different products provide different benefits. With all that said my number one makeup remover is tatcha. The main reason it's number one is because of all the brands and different types of makeup removers, its the most efficient and easy to use. The only bummer is, it's kind of expensive, but you get what you pay for in life. The scent is very faint, I'm okay with that. With some cleansing balms, they become milky and get kind of messy and you see and feel makeup running off your face. Or they go on really oily and thick. Some cleansing oils aren't necessarily strong enough so you end up having to really rub. Here's where tatcha comes into play, the first time I used Tatcha I was nervous because I didn't see makeup running and there was no milky residue. So I was concerned with whether or not it worked. The make-up just came off with no mess or fuss , I wasn't used to that kind of symplicity. I realized every ounce of makeup was off my face. I was amazed at how clean and efficient this product was. This product is not greasy, It goes on lightweight and it basically feels like nothing's happening. Yet everything comes off your face, it is seamless. The only other cleansing oil that comes really close to tatcha is Boscia, it's a close second but very nice too. However, tatcha is king.

Skin Type Normal",4 stars,"This oil cleanser does a wonderful job taking off makeup and sunscreen at the end of the day, and the pump packaging is extremely convenient and hygienic. However, I have noticed that if I do not follow up the Tatcha with a second foamy or gel cleanser, there is a slight oily film left on my face that I'm not a huge fan of. Perhaps this would work as a 2-in-1 cleanser for someone with more dehydrated skin or is transitioning away from very stripping cleansers/treatments? As someone who already layers on hydrating essences, serums, and moisturizers, I typically like my cleanser to be a bit more thorough. But not too stripping! If your cleanser is making your face squeak/tight, then its too much for your skin and you definitely need something gentler. I would recommend people who are experiencing issues with this product to follow up with a second cleanser, as not everyone's face responds positively to rich facial oils. Although facial oils higher in oleic acid (like the camellia oil used in this product) are richer and more moisturizing than oils high in linoleic acid, there is an increased (but not guaranteed) risk of clogged pores. But if you know that your skin enjoys facial oils high in oleic acid, like olive, avocado, sweet almond, etc., then maybe this could be your HG 2-in-1 cleanser! However in my case, as a makeup remover alone, I would give this oil cleanser 5 stars, but I am knocking 1 star off simply because of the price. As a 2-in-1, I might be able to justify the price, but definitely not as a stand alone makeup remover.

This has all the benefits of oil cleansing without any of the mess. The product smells wonderful—just a light scent—and easily breaks down makeup. The best part? It emulsifies when it touches water, making it easy to wash off. My skin feels hydrated afterwards, but not oily. The product also lasts a lot longer than you think. After a couple of weeks, I went out and bought another bottle thinking I would go through this one quickly, but my first bottle lasted me almost 9 months with almost daily use. The pump on the bottle makes it easy to dispense the correct amount, too. I only wish Sephora sold a travel-size version of this product, as it's a bit cumbersome to travel with.

My mom (who is 72) asked how this is different than a cold cream. This is not as creamy as a traditional ""cold cream"". It is a thick ""balm"" that leaves a thin film on your face and is very easily washed off with water. I follow with a simple cleanser (cetaphil is my favorite), to get any remaining residue off.

For this reason, I usually only use this in the shower & use a different cleansing oil if I'm taking my makeup off at the sink.

A huge feat for my insanely sensitive skin. This is only of the only products I use that is not explicitly clean as I've done for over a decade now -- which is telling. I just couldn't part from it.

She said she doesnt any more. Just this bottle. Her face looked nice and oil/shine free. So, I purchased the kit. I used the products faithfully and after two weeks, my face started to break out and my shine was never reduced. I stopped using the toner and kept using the other two bottles for 2 more weeks. After those 2 weeks, my face looked horrible and was very irritated. I had pimples and cysts that would not go away. I had to stop using the products. I could barely use foundation. Anything that touch my face made it feel like it was on fire. I had to go to a dermatologist and be prescribed doxycycline and a retinoid cream. After 3 months of that regimen, the pimples and cysts went away. Then, I ran into two fellow nurses who tried this product and broke out and were prescribed doxycycline as well. Don't do it ladies and gents! There's better products out to maintain an acne free face.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I am amazed by this product! I was hesitant at first, as this product has salicylic acid in it and wondering if using it once daily would dry out my skin. I've been using this product for almost a month and I've had nothing but great results. I wouldn't consider myself to have oily skin (I'm more combination skin) but the ingredients salicylic acid and glycolic acid are great for sloughing off dead skin cells and removing dirt and excess sebum. While I wasn't miracles, as I've dealt with somewhat cystic acne for years, it has really improved my skin by shrinking my pores like it says it does, providing that extra deep clean without damaging the skin, and seems to be speeding up the healing process of previous blemishes/pimples. I also follow-up with a glycolic acid night cream. When using glycolic acid products, sunscreen is a must since glycolic acid acts in the same way as a facial scrub or mild facial peel. I also really love the tingling feeling after applying it, as it gives me a deep clean feeling without being too stripping of natural oils. Bonus is that it's under Sephora's 'Clean Beauty' products. Love that too. As you can tell, I am loving this product and it's been a game changer for me. I've been quite satisfied using other Olehenriksen products as well and this experience definitely gives me more confidence in trying out other products from this line.

I like when you exfoliate, and feel a sensation like you actually did something. It tingles and my face goes red for a little while and then feels the softest it has ever been. I cannot get these results with anything else. Mary Kay exfoliation comes close to it minus the ingredients you get in this. The price is what I cannot get past. I got mine in a subscription box.

It’s not a sickeningly sweet smell either. It literally smells like you just cut into an orange. It’s the perfect balance of zest and sweetness (can you tell I’m totally into citrus smells? Lol) it does not have a chemical cleanser scent. It just feels so refreshing every morning! This does not strip your skin so you don’t get that squeaky clean feeling like you can get with other cleansers. I have hormonal acne prone skin plus obnoxious eczema so lots of things (especially things with fragrance) tend to irritate my skin. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has not flared or irritated my eczema and has not broken me out. While I know the fragrance is probably not the best for my skin, it just smells sooooo good! It’s just a cleanser and I wash it off quickly so as long as my skin isn’t reacting, I’m okay with it!

I always use a makeup wipe to get the majority of my makeup off and use a cleanser afterwards. Unless I do a cleansing balm and hot towel in between, I will almost always get some makeup off when I use a toner with a cotton pad. With this cleanser, that doesn’t happen. Additionally, the scent is so juicy and pleasant. It’s citrusy and refreshing. At this fair price, I’ll be sure to stock up on this to always have it by the sink and the shower. A+!

That and the YTTP cleanser would leak out of the pump whenever I tried to use a half-pump for morning cleanses. In any case, while YTTP is great, this Olehenriksen Truth Juice is LOVELY. It smells amazing, the squeeze bottle delivery means I can better control how much I use (which is a little smaller than a dime size), my skin appears to have brightened, and my texture has improved. On top of that, it removes every trace of makeup at the end of the day without a double cleanse. 10/10 would recommend, especially for my oily folks.

I used the Oil Control cleanser by Ole Henriksen before switching to this one and it worked well before on my skin. But now it’s making me feel a little dry considering that winter is still ending and the temperatures are slightly cold. I’ve only been using this for 5 days in a row now and I can already see good changes. My skin looks so much brighter and radiant, and the very tiny bit of acne I had on my right cheek is starting to diminish. This has been working amazing along with my other skincare products (serum, oil, etc). And I enjoy the scent, it smells like an orange candy. I take it my skin is not so sensitive since the fragrance has had no negative effect, but that may be something to consider for extremely sensitive skin!! My face feels more hydrated now, perhaps during summer I will go back to my oil control cleanser :)

Second, I don’t care for the smell at all. I also felt as though I was using more of this product per use and I went through the whole container faster than I have with the previous two brands mentioned. I suggest spending your money on Farmacy’s balm...it’s the same price, but works so much better.

An added bonus is this is refreshing and smells so good. I also love the packaging. A huge pet peeve is when I put bottles in my bag and the top comes off ( especially when the bottles are spray bottles). The top stays on so well and is a pleasure for travel use.

If you read the ingredients you can see that not only does it have alcohol (doesn’t matter that it’s naturally derived, that is a super drying ingredient), it’s all things that you can access easily and thus this toner is easily dupe-able vía DIY. It’s just water, alcohol, and essential oils like rosemary and mint. By the way, the rosemary and mint can be really astringent and harsh, especially when you get to the end of the bottle (which wastes a lot of product). I also don’t like the packaging - the glass bottle is really heavy and the lid/sprayer are a weird material that feels really cheap. Please just make this yourself. Can’t believe this is $49!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"After being introduced to a soothing mist that my esthetic nurse friend gave me a sample of, I wrestled within myself on whether or not I should incorporate something like that in my skincare routine. Also, I remember years ago that an esthetician I knew years ago would use one of Dermalogica's additives (I think it was the Clearing Additive) in my treatments and I loved it. Before using the soothing mist, I wouldn't even give any consideration about buying something like this as I would have deemed it as unnecessary. Also, the Dermalogica Additive provided one of the best experiences I've had during a facial (other than the pops, of course). So, after using mostly fragrance-free or no-added fragrance products in my skincare routine (as well as my husband complaining that some of the products did have an aversive scent. I don't blame him as I felt the same way), I found myself missing that sensory element of smelling spa-like aromas. Also, I consider my skincare routine to be a slice of time that I have for myself. Ultimately, I bought a bottle of this stuff as it turned out to be gentle on my skin (I made sure to test it out first by spritzing it each time I went to a Sephora), which is great because it does list ""parfum"" as part of its ingredients. Also, the sprayer produces very fine mists that feels like a true moisture boost (kind of like a light humidifier feeling) as opposed to a feeling like small drops landed on my skin & falling down on my face like tears. I don't find myself fanning my face after using this. The elements of a great spray mechanism, soothing to my face, & the spa-like sensory experience are the top reasons why I decided to buy this. The fact that it can be easily purchased at popular store like Sephora is an added bonus. Is this product ""extra""? Perhaps. However, I do find the sensory experiences of things, especially something I do every single day, important as it does give me a sense of calm, as well as provide nice added moisture.

The 125ml lasted me one month, but I use it every night - it’s difficult to dose the right quantity and you might endup wasting a good amount of it if you’re not careful. I would’ve loved a better dispensing system.

As I was using those, I noticed I have to rub my eyes excessively to remove my washable mascara, which damaged my eyelashes. I was looking for smth better, that would remove efortlessly my makeup. I did my research and saw Clinique makeup remover being so popular here, having tons of amazing reviews, including those that said it's much better than bi-facil, I was also very pleased with the price, so I decided to buy biggest size and was waiting for my product with excitement. Now I want to explain very detailed what is the difference between bifacil (bf) and clinique (cl), when you look at both bottles they seem to have relatively same amount of liquid and oil, but ones you use cotton pad with cl and start using it on your eyes, you notice only oil, no liquid, you have to rub same amount of time like with bf, but it's super oily, greasy, gets into your eyes and irritates them, mascara does not just melt on the pad like with bf, but flakes and those flakes dragg everywhere on your face, so you need either a makeup removing wipe or another cotton pad with a more liquid product to remove all that mess. Bf feels more liquidy, not too oily, does not get into your eyes and melts mascara in a way that it transfers to the pad in a clean way. I only need to use one pad with bf eyes and 1 bf for face, with cl I need much more pads and more work and the whole process is messy and oily. Now I am left with jumbo size of this product that I have to use somehow, as I don't like to waste or return stuff, but I learned my lesson, I will never buy a makeup remover without trying a sampler. What I found to be removing mascara easier and gentlier is Tatcha camelia cleansing oil and if any of you guys will find a double phase makeup remover that really works, please dm me.

The tube makes for easy and clean dispensing. Mine came in a kit with the anti wrinkle serum and exfoliator. I stopped using my Fresh products a few days ago to try Kate and I feel like the cleanser is drying my skin out and I had some breakouts and it doesn’t seem to do anything for them. I’m only on day 4 of using it. but my skin doesn’t look nearly as hydrated as when I was using some of the Fresh products. I only tried the exfoliator on the first day so I don’t think that is the issue. I already have dry/combination skin and live in Southern California and the weather is getting colder so maybe just isn’t meant for my skin type in this climate at the moment. I really wanted to like this one because the ingredients are very good for the skin.

The smell is fresh and sweet. The formula is dreamy. It's soft, it's foamy, and just perfect. I've never had a problem with dryness or that tightness that sometimes comes after cleansing. It doesn't make my skin feel oily, either. It's just great. I could rave on about this for a long time, but I urge anyone here to try it. The exfoliating features are subtle, but I do notice a difference in my skin since using this. Kate Somerville, I love you.

I have this toner and then a strong toner for other purposes. The petals do get on your cotton pad, but they don't ever end up on my face. They stick to the pad, so I wouldn't let that deter you.

It's mild but effectively cleans my face, and it's just so refreshing to have an alcohol-free toner that feels good on the face. When I use regular toners, the alcohol often removes too much grease from my face and makes the dry/oily parts worse. This one does everything just perfectly, not to mention it smells great!! It's a mild, tea-like scent that makes me feel better every time I use it. I'm on my second bottle.

I thought it was a hormonal breakout leading up to my period, so I continued to use this toner. The bumps got worse and I switched back to my regular toner (Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, which I'm not in love with since it dries my skin out despite clearing out my acne) for about a week and the bumps went away. After my period, I tried out the REN toner again to see if I'd break out, putting it on in the morning. Later that evening, I noticed the small forehead pimples came back. I will likely exchange what's left of the product for another toner that is more gentle on my skin.

I was under the impression that this toner is gentle enough to use daily, but if you use a vitamin C serum in the AM and chemical exfoliants or retinol products in the PM, then you are really not supposed to combine this toner with those exfoliants. I didn't realize that in the beginning and ended up with a very irritated chin!! after much research, and speaking with someone at Ren, I discovered vitamin C and acid toners shouldn't be combined. The company should do a better job explaining that to us. It's not a big deal but it's somewhat a bummer as I was hoping this toner could be used every morning. But I'll have to get another gentle toner for daily use and use this once or twice a week only when I skip on the vitamin C.

If your skin really likes Good Genes from Sunday Riley, it will probably like this as both are mainly lactic acid. For my skin, it’s far superior to the pixi glow tonic, the Ole Henrikson dark spot toner (in the blue bottle), or the first aid beauty radiance pads. Also why would anyone buy the 250 ml when the 500 ml is an extra $9? It’s DOUBLE THE PRODUCT!

I love the well-pump it has for application, you just place a cotton pad over it and press down, usually one to two pumps is enough for me. I have been using this every morning and night for 3 weeks and the bottle is still more than three quarters full. It does not have a fragrance as listed under the Ren Clean Skincare label along with other things it does not have. It offers very gentle exfoliation on my dry/combination aging skin and even completely got rid of some tiny flesh colored bumps I was starting to get under my eyes, which surprisingly did not irritate the surrounding eye area. My skin does feel a little bit sticky after application, but nothing too bothersome. It really gets rid of any remaining dirt and dead skin cells after washing my face. I have also noticed an actual glow with continued use of this product. I have a lot of little dark hyperpigmentation spots from a deep laser resurfacing treatment I had a year ago and am trying out everything to see what works on them. I think this does make my skin more even toned, but I’m also currently using Korres wild rose Vitamin C oil and their moisturizers that claim to lighten dark spots. Either way, I will continue to buy this toner as I find it does not dry out my skin like other toners I have tried before and it makes my skin feel nice and look healthier.

I carry it in my purse and spray it directly on my face, usually in the middle of the day when I can feel my skin getting tired and stressed out. It definitely soothes my stressed out skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and looking slightly dewy. My only problem is that the smell is somewhat off-putting. It just smells like baby lotion. It goes away after a while though, so it's not a big deal. In my opinion, this is a little pricey for a toner, but it is also marketed as like a toner essence deal. If you have oily skin like me, this may be worth the price as I think it definitely does help balance my skin.

I bought the brightening one instead of the purifying one because it was suggested to me by one of the girls there and because they don’t sell the purifying one in store at my local Sephora, but I’m glad I did. It’s helped to brighten my skin and lighten my old acne scars. I’ve repurchased this 3 times already and have been using it for about a year and a half with my Clarisonic and I can’t imagine using any other cleanser. I feel like you do get your money’s worth since one pump is more than enough for your whole face. I also love using it as a mask, I usually just leave it on my skin for a few minutes before I rinse off and I’m done! I’ve definitely found my HG cleanser in this one. Btw, summer or winter this cleanser will leave your skin feeling clean without feeling tight or like there’s a residue.

Each time I tried this foundation when I was dealing with big pores and texture I absolutely hated it. On the opposite side.. when my skin is in incredible condition with no flaws I’m OBSESSED with this foundation! If I have no skin issues.. this product makes my skin look like porcelain and I get complimented everywhere I go on how amazing my skin looks.

No matter what I did my face would just look cakey and aged and gross. I have oily/combo skin so i thought that after a few hours my natural oils would help but it just *refused* to melt into my skin, it would just sit there on top of my face and it was just heavy which is a rare thing for me to feel! It didn't help that I got the wrong colors twice (but that's my bad lmao) so I would look super pale on top of that. :( I finally gave up and ended up giving it to my mom as a bonus V-day gift. The day after my last attempt I used a $10 colourpop foundation and I was suddenly reminded of what a good makeup base is supposed to look like.

The next day, I tried applying it with my fingers only, working on a single section of my face at a time. I used the smallest amount possible to prevent caking but still achieve some coverage for my rosacea. Once again, it looked awful about 2 hours into wear. I returned it.

Honestly, it’s extremely full coverage like it covers a lot, so if you like that then this is for you. however no matter how little i apply, it looks cakey and very dry on my skin. It clings to dry patches and makes my forehead look terrible and my nose! Never had an issue with any other foundation either. Also, after blending it all out with a sponge, I notice that my cheeks look like they lost coverage like it removed the product. don’t know why that is. I use the shade Fair Light which i believe is the lightest shade & it’s so yellow . I’m not a fan of this product.

I would agree with others that this is not a 'lightweight' foundation, but also I don't think it's trying to be that. If you want lightweight, look elsewhere. If you want full coverage, definitely try this one. I would also agree that the silver coating on the package does wear off, which just isn't what I'd expect at this pricepoint, but more so with drugstore makeup. All in all, I love this product and love that there's 50 SPF. Anything lower than that is useless.

I've been on a moisturizer mission doing trials of quite a few different popular moisturizers. I received this as a sample. I have combination skin, but during the winter months my skin can definitely handle heavier night creams. The first night I used this I noticed it didn't absorb into my skin the way most other moisturizers/night creams do. It absorbed, but left a greasy veil on my face that didn't feel right. I rolled with it and went to bed. The next day I woke up and my skin felt normal, I went makeup free since I had nowhere I had to be. That night when I was washing my face I felt some cysts starting to come up, which I haven't had in awhile. Stupidly, I used it again for a few more days wanting to give it a fair shot. Nope. My skin continued to erupt with more cysts than I've ever had at one time, and on TOP of that I had a ton of small whiteheads which I never really get. If this product works for you then hey, you're lucky. I personally feel like there's some ingredient in there that was an extreme pore clogger for me. I truly do wish I would have loved it, unfortunately it just didn't agree with me.

I wish I had read some of the reviews about this product not being ideal for oily/acne prone skin. So please be aware that just because a product is expensive and a cult favourite, doesn't mean it's ideal for you!

I’ve been using nivea creme for the past month to help with very dry winter skin and have loved the feel and results. I find both a tad on the thick side which creates a lot of tugging on the skin unless you have the patience to pat on your moisturizer. I’ve been adding about 4 drops of kiehls midnight repair serum (another must have) and it really helps to thin it out enough for a smoother application (highly recommend). And in 100% honesty after having tried both I prefer the nivea creme. When it dries it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin which I found la mer does and makes it hard to apply makeup on. And the other obvious con is the price. Other then that these products are practically identical right down to the scent. I am honestly shocked so many people would choose la mer over nivea. It’s practically the same creme minus the price tag.

Could not get it warmed between my fingers to translucency no matter how I tried - and then I started to wonder why I should have to do this? Why am I moisturizing my fingers instead of my face? Was extremely thick to apply. Took overnight to absorb - or perhaps just rubbed off on my pillowcase? Gifted this to my sis who is a fan, and went back to my beloved Dior. All is well in the kingdom now.

It is a pretty thick cream formula, which I personally do not like or need, but if you have extremely dry skin, this would be pretty hydrating. That being said, there is absolutely no reason for this price tag. The sample lasted me for a month and it didn't do anything special for my skin. Some of my favorite moisturizers do more to hydrate and smooth my skin throughout the day and are at least 60% cheaper than this product. La Mer's big schtick is that their ""miracle brew"" is composed of fermented sea kelp; there are plenty of other brands and products that have sea kelp that are more effective and at a much lower price point. This product did not keep my skin hydrated all day, like it claims, which is saying something since I don't deal with dry skin in the first place. If someone wants a luxury product for the sake of it, by all means, go nuts. However, this product is a great example of how a luxury price tag doesn't equal effective results. Save your money and look into other products that have better, more effective ingredients and better price tags.

If I do have any dry patches, I'll top this with a bit of marula oil on those areas only, it never pills up and I've actually noticed my makeup lasts longer. I wish it came in an airless pump but I bought one from Amazon and I find it helps me use less. I get about 3 months out of the 1.6 oz tub. I've used the Belif Moisture Bomb at night and the Eye Bomb day and night for years and the entire line is fantastic.

It works exceptionally well at improving the appearance of a scar that I have on my forehead, as well as significantly diminishing the wrinkles on my forehead. Like other reviewers, when I first started wearing this, it dried quickly and I felt that it wasn't moisturizing enough. However, I kept using it, and would sometimes add another more occlusive moisturizer on top ( I prefer heavier moisturizers). I am in week 3 of using it, and hate that I like it so much. If you like heavy moisturizers (FAB, DE Protini, Belief Moisture Bomb), then this will take some getting used to. Also, I think the differences in reviews might stem from the skin you start with. I don't see this cream doing wonders for my cheeks (I don't have any problems there - in fact I need more moisture there), but I see it doing wonders for my forehead where I have wrinkles, a scar and had teenage acne).

My skin is sensitive to almost every moisturizer out there but La Mer soft cream never breaks me out. Sometimes tried-and-true, simpler products are better. La Mer is great and they don’t need neon packaging or fake reviews to sell their stellar products.

I had to add oil (rose hips, marula or the Ordinary's B Oil) into this moisturizer to give it a little more ooph (unfortunately, I look like an oil slick for a few minutes after doing so). Also, I don't see it adding much into my skin. Not as moisturizing as DE Protini or FAB, and doesn't improve my skin like La Mer (don't laugh...I am a skincare junkie...La Mer's soft cream honestly improved my problem area).

I’m only giving it 4 stars because I’ve found that it can be very tricky to get to apply well and last for the day. I do have acne prone skin with texture so it could just be my skin.

I came across this a couple of years ago, and have been very happy. Tried another brand recently, just cuz, and it was a good comparison...and testimony as to how good THIS tinted moisturizer is. I'm actually not a huge advocate for sunscreen on a daily basis b/c we need Vitamin D. And the little bit of sun I get, going about my daily business, isn't enough to warrant sunscreen, IMO. I also have a lot of melanin in my skin, so I'm fortunate there (less risk of skin cancer). That being said, I LOVE that this SPF is mineral based. The typical chemical based sunscreens are hormone and endocrine disruptors. My life has changed since I started removing all of the chemical junk from my skin and body care. My periods are more regulated, with less cramping. bareMinerals does a really great job at keeping their products clean. I just switched to their blush b/c of this, and am super happy with it, as well. The coverage is great with this, while still providing moisture and movement in the skin. And I love that the colors blend so well. I'm a 6 Ginger in winter, and a 9.5 Terra in the summer. In spring and summer, as my skin transitions color, I mix the two. Overall, IMO, this is the best there is. It offers everything you could possibly need!!

I’ve tried prescription topicals, diets, supplements, a myriad of face washes, skincare systems and spot treatments, adapalene, etc. I’ve tried almost everything. I think the issue is that my skin is not at all oily, but instead is dry and sensitive, so most acne products just make it worse. Then I found SKII. In combination with Shiseido Ultimune, used daily for about 3 months, I’ve noticed an improvement in texture/scarring, discoloration and dryness. My skin responds to almost nothing, so for there to be a visible change at all is incredible. I think it’s the fungi that are in both products, honestly. I highly recommend this if your skin is sensitive, aging acne prone. If nothing else works, try this. I feel like people who are blessed with naturally clear and generally balanced complexions may not notice much of change, but for those of us that continually struggle this is a godsend.

There is a slightly fermented smell that is intolerable to some, but honestly fades within moments of application. It has a watery consistency and did keep my skin feeling soft and balanced over the years, always ready for my serums and moisturizers. However, the reason why I am discontinuing my usage of this product and only giving it 3 stars is that it is simply too expensive for what it is. The main and honestly only noteworthy ingredient in this product is pitera, which is a fermented product of yeast, with proven benefits to the skin (from limited research that was conducted by the company that owns SK-ii). And that's it. At less than half this price point, you can find all kinds of Korean and Japanese essences and toners that are packed full of other goodies like antioxidants, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is a great product! But after having used it for all these years, I do not think it is worth the luxury price tag. But if you do find yourself loving pitera, I would recommend that you turn to the SK-ii facial clear lotion toner, as there are additional AHAs in there (in addition to the pitera) to make the price tag more worthwhile.

Everything it claims to do, it does (for me anyway). I saw a noticeable difference after just one use. I suggest wearing it overnight. I wait several minutes to let my serums dry, and replace my moisturizer with this once or twice a week. I wake up with plump, glowing skin every time.

So when I got the news that I was receiving a vox box full of Fresh products, while grateful, I didn't expect them to be amazing. Boy was I wrong; my socks have been blown off bye how intuitive this skincare is! I've incorporated 3 of the Lotus Youth Preserve products into my skincare routine and am floored with the results. One of the most surprising anecdotes is my combo skin didn't react negatively to any of the products...AT ALL. I usually have at least a few days of skin grumpiness when I try new products but all 3 worked perfectly for my sensitive skin. I do still get blemishes once in awhile due to me forgetting to wash my pillowcase as frequent as I should. When that happens, I start putting a vitamin c concentrate underneath the Lotus Dream Cream and it sorts it right out.  My skin feels more moisturized, supple/plump, calmed, and a bit more radiant. Everything in the lotus line has a cucumbery relaxing scent. The consistency of the Lotus YP Moisturizer (daytime) cream feels a bit gelatinous, like a hydrating cucumber mask...but it absorbs wonderfully into the skin and doesn't leave a weird residue. The day cream keeps my skin well-hydrated throughout the day without getting greasy under makeup. I've noticed a little dab goes a long way. I also admire the prettiness of the Lotus line packaging/design, and how durable/thick the containers are. This is ideal for a clumsy gal like myself. :) And thank you Fresh for making the night cream container a different color from the day and eye cream containers! It's way easier to not mix them up when my glasses are off for the day. Highly recommend you grab yourself all 3 Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve products as they seem to work symbiotically together!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"I have been using this night cream for several weeks now, and it leaves my skin amazingly soft the next morning. Of course, having a good skin care routine does a lot for that, but the first day after using it, I woke up and my skin felt so soft, so I know the cream contributed too. This cream smells like cucumbers and lemons. Literally, smells like you cut up real cucumbers and squeezed a yellow lemon on top. Not unpleasant, and some may find it refreshing. It's not my favorite scents, but at least it wasn't a bad smell. Also, this cream is advertised to have a ""comforting peach scent"". I can smell a very faint hint of peach if I apply the cream to skin that has no other product on it, but it's very faint and doesn't linger long. And during my normal routine, I don't really smell the peach because the other product scents mask it. I'm glad, because I actually strongly dislike peach scent and would not have used the product if that scent was stronger or lingered on me. The cream is white and has a very pleasant buttery texture without being greasy. It's not thick enough to feel heavy, but heavy enough to feel moisturizing and substantial. Again, it doesn't feel greasy on the skin, just buttery and it sinks right in. For those of you who are concerned about texture, I'd describe it as right in the middle between a thick cream and a bouncy gel. Not overly heavy, and not thin. The cream didn't make me break out. I have normal-oily skin that still gets dry and ashy. I can't say for sure that this cream brightened it, but it did moisturize. Overall, this was a product I enjoyed using and would recommend. Even though another cream holds the title of being my favorite, I'm giving 5 stars because it performed to my satisfaction. And, finally, I didn't count this as part of the 5 stars because ultimately it's least important, but the jar is gorgeous. In case you have small kids, know that it's a glass jar with a mirror-finish plastic lid.

I feel the difference and see it every time I look in the mirror. I really enjoy the Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream and the combination of using these 3 products daily has rejuvenated my facial skin and gives me a younger appearance, and at 61 years old, I never thought this was possible.  These products are now part of my daily routine, and they have a permanent place on my bathroom counter. I received this product as a free sample.

My skin had been so nice recently, but the moment I applied this to my face, ALL of the dry patches appeared. Looking at my face, I just couldn’t find one silver lining in it. I’d never been so hasty about it before, but I really had to re-wash my face and apply something else immediately. Just...yipes....

So when I got the news that I was receiving a vox box full of Fresh products, while grateful, I didn't expect them to be amazing. Boy was I wrong; my socks have been blown off bye how intuitive this skincare is! I've incorporated 3 of the Lotus Youth Preserve products into my skincare routine and am floored with the results. One of the most surprising anecdotes is my combo skin didn't react negatively to any of the products...AT ALL. I usually have at least a few days of skin grumpiness when I try new products but all 3 worked perfectly for my sensitive skin. I do still get blemishes once in awhile due to me forgetting to wash my pillowcase as frequent as I should. When that happens, I start putting a vitamin c concentrate underneath the Lotus Dream Cream and it sorts it right out.  My skin feels more moisturized, supple/plump, calmed, and a bit more radiant. Everything in the lotus line has a cucumbery relaxing scent. The consistency of the Lotus YP Moisturizer (daytime) cream feels a bit gelatinous, like a hydrating cucumber mask...but it absorbs wonderfully into the skin and doesn't leave a weird residue. The day cream keeps my skin well-hydrated throughout the day without getting greasy under makeup. I've noticed a little dab goes a long way. I also admire the prettiness of the Lotus line packaging/design, and how durable/thick the containers are. This is ideal for a clumsy gal like myself. :) And thank you Fresh for making the night cream container a different color from the day and eye cream containers! It's way easier to not mix them up when my glasses are off for the day. Highly recommend you grab yourself all 3 Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve products as they seem to work symbiotically together!

I have normal to oily skin with dehydration, so I love feeling like I'm pampering my skin with really rich creams, but I can't really use those much because they tend to leave me feeling sticky and oily. Well, the texture of this one is buttery, thick, and smooth. When I first apply it it feels rich and comforting, but it doesn't sit on my skin for long before sinking right in. It feels like a rich cream as you apply, but then sinks in like a gel within 2 minutes. So if you do/don't like the feel of a rich cream, or if you do/don't want your cream to absorb like a gel, or if you need more/less hydration, this cream is kind of a mix of all that. Once it absorbs, my skin feels comfortable and soft, not greasy, and fully dry but not tight. It's kind of the perfect feel for me. The scent is like fresh cucumbers with lemon. Not my favorite scent, but it's not unpleasant. And it doesn't sting my eyes. The only reason I removed a star is because several times, after a few hours I start getting an awful smell from it. It's the smell of oils that went stale. Whenever I've had a face oil go bad, I've thrown it away because it's a hard smell to tolerate. I haven't thrown out this cream, but, I might have to if the smell keeps appearing. Maybe I got a bad batch.

After purchasing yellow facial moisturizer in a square bottle from department stores since I was a teenager, and occasionally trying high-end products from drug stores, I was skeptical about trying yet another face moisturizer but am wowed with the results of these 3 products!  The Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer has a light, pleasant scent and goes on smoothly, keeping my face looking clean and fresh throughout the day.  It is not greasy or heavy, but makes a big impact on my skin.  I've received several compliments about how good my skin looks since I started using these products 2 months ago.

I noticed a difference with this moisturizer immediately and love that even though it's thick it sinks into your skin so effortlessly.

I’ve seen tremendous improvements in the texture of my skin. I am usually acne prone with red scarring (mostly hormonal and stress induced) along with horrible dry patches on my cheeks and nose.

The packaging is lux and feels expensive. I knew that it would be heavily fragranced as many people have voiced their concerns about this since so many people have or can develop sensitivities to fragrance. I don’t mind fragrance and found this cream to smell pleasant and luxurious, but I think that many people will consider buying this if they’d only offer a fragrance-free version. The cream is very dense and sinks into my skin very quickly. I was quite surprised by this. It never broke me out either, which was awesome. It also worked really well with my sunscreen and my makeup and left my skin with a lovely glow as you can see in my photo. I never felt greasy or oily, even after wearing it all day long. Overall, I really liked this cream; however, I’m not sure I can justify the high price for this product. It’s really the only issue that I could find with the cream and though I really do love the cream, I’m not sure if I could afford to purchase it regularly.

First of all, the packaging is beautiful and I leave it out on my vanity. The cream itself is thick and has a mild, pleasant ""classic"" scent. I have normal to oily, 30 something year old skin, and I am really enjoying this cream. I feel like it absorbs nicely (I saw a video with Charlotte herself saying that you should let it absorb a few minutes before continuing with the rest of your routine). My face feels smooth and looks radiant. Although it is pretty pricey, you do get a good amount of product. I've been using it twice daily for over a month and I would estimate there's about 2/3 remaining. I'm interested in trying other products from the brand and will likely purchase the Magic Cream when I finish it.

I decided to try this and was pleasantly surprised. No breakouts or irritation and my skin feels hydrated all day long! I'll have to see how this works for me during the summer but I'm hopeful it won't leave me feeling too oily. It also works well under my liquid foundation (which I rarely wear) or under powder sunscreen (my daily sunscreen). My only disappointment with this product is the container. Although I always have clean hands when using, I would prefer a pump to minimize introduction of contaminants. Just FYI, aside from the largest size (which is the cheapest per ml), the 1.7 oz/50ml is the cheapest per ml. I guess they assume most people won't calculate it.

The only reason I don't use it under make-up is because I use a SPF moisturizer if I'm going out; thus, am putting make-up on.

I seriously sneezed the first few times I put it on, it reminds me of something my grandmother would wear. Then, after I had already purchased it, I did a quick search to see if Bobbi Brown products are cruelty-free. I assumed they were because, well, I like Bobbi and she seems lovely? Lol. But she is NOT CRUELTY-FREE. There is no reason to not be cruelty-free in 2020!! There are so many great brands that are good to the planet.

But what it does do — and does it amazingly — is prep your skin to a moisture level that is prime and ready for foundation. It seems to just normalize skin moisture so that your foundation seeps in nicely and imparts a sort of “glow” to the final outcome. I don’t use this on very humid days. But being in Vegas, humidity is not a big issue. On hot summer days, I also don’t use this because my combo skin doesn’t need more moisture. But for the rest of the year, especially on days where my regular moisturizer feels like it wasn’t *quite* enough — this is the primer I go to. I scoop out a small amount onto my palm, and dab a bit onto my cheeks, forehead and chin, and then I rub it in all over, including my eyes, prior to putting on foundation.

From Nars to Ole Henriksen’s Banana Bright to Too Faced to Smashbox to Milk Makeup HydroGrip to Lancôme... and the list goes on. None of them worked as well as this one. My skin is combination and acne prone with some texture. This stuff is a dream, it smells amazing and dries smoothly and it’s not sticky! My makeup looks great all day even after a 10 hour shift ( I only powder around my nose/forehead about one to two times throughout the shift). But I highly recommend this even for the price - it is soooooo worth it.

Didnt think much about the 'gel' part at first but I actually really like it because it's just slightly more of an effort to rub it in meaning it goes exactly where I want to focus it not just everywhere. It is very rich and refreshing when you put it on but pretty thick so I only use it at night as I don't know if it would be too heavy during the day or under makeup.

It applies great and has built-in sunscreen, which is always a plus. It can be a bit shiny when first applied, but (in my experience) it mellows out with time and gives my skin a lovely vibrancy. I would give it five stars, but I have really sensitive skin, and I think it's giving me a few tiny (like really small) breakouts. That being said, my skin is quite finicky, and hopefully, with the right cleansing routine, I can minimize, if not eliminate, these issues. All the same, others with more sensitive skin should consider approaching this product with mild caution.

However, while I can live without ""Good Genes"", I don't see myself giving this up anytime soon. I noticed a difference after the first night I used it: my skin looked calmer and clearer, with noticeable fading around acne scars. I also don't mind the smell or color; I've actually come to associate the smell with sleepy-time which I'd like to imagine helps me psychologically wind-down before bed. I currently use this every other night (I alternate between this and Drunk Elephant's TLC framboos) and my skin tone is getting better and better. Rest assured this isn't a fake review. However, the first ethical brand to make a comparable product without trying to defraud consumers with phony reviews about others will get my business.

So I was very excited to try other Dr. Jart products, and had been planning to buy this as soon as my regular moisturizer ran out. The feel is incredible, and I'm sure it's a good product, I just can't use it because of the heavy fragrance which gives me a headache. Besides, it's very well known in the skincare community that fragrance is irritating to the skin.

It definitely is eczema and I was prescribed with a ointment. However I needed a daily moisturizer that would help me. After trying multiple creams, I thought I found my holy grail. Why do I say that? Because when I first put apply this cream, you can definitely feel the difference of how moisturizing it feels on vs the other creams I’ve tried. It’s a little on the heavy side but a little does not o a long way for me. It kept my face moist for a bit, I definitely didn’t have that “tight dry” feeling on my face anymore. But I noticed I did have to keep reapplying throughout the day because I can see the patches started to flake and feel dry. Even through these past couple days of -30 degree weather, I felt it didn’t do a great job considering I would still flake. Even when I apply this after my night routine and I wake up in the morning, I’m still flaky and dry. I’ve had this for about a week and I’m half way through the tube.. mind you it is quite expensive so I definitely had to find another cream. (Good news I have and I’m going to write a review for it because I actually found something that worked!!) I would say that this will work for someone with dry skin but not extremely dry flaky skin.

DDML has never caused problems. It is fragrance free. I also use the Clinique mild bar soap for cleansing. I’ve never found anything to replace that, either. A lot of cleansers (for example, Cetaphil) give me a rash. In the worst months of winter, I sometimes use Moisture Surge Intense over this. People still compliment me on my skin. I have very few lines, smooth texture, and I don’t have enlarged pores. One caveat, know your skin type! Cleansers and moisturizers are geared to skin type. If you have oily skin, this will probably be too much moisture.

This does tend to have a slightly heavier feel on the face, but it does absorb pretty well. I'm relegating this to night time only use, on very dry skin days for now.... On the plus side, it is very affordable, and I actually quite like it as a hand creme, if nothing else.

My true test of a good moisturizer is if I wake up in the morning after washing my face and using the moisturizer the night before and seeing if my skin is oily. The first time I tried it, I was so pleasantly surprised. I never write reviews for products, but I felt this one deserved it. Seriously, if you feel like you've tried everything and want to give up, try this first.

First of all it gave me breakouts over my chin and my jaw. I didn’t want to think it was this so I tried to use it again after my break out went away. Nope, my face broke out again!!!!!!!! I don’t know too much about ingredients but I bought this because I saw all kinds of skincare channels raving about the ingredients in this. In addition, I feel like the texture is really weird, it is almost waxy and it does want to blend out on my skin evenly or skin in. It leaves a film on my skin with a white cast, not that I mind the white cast b/c I use this product at night, but I mean I have dryer skin and I live in upstate NY(winter here is terrible)so I like heavy things. This thing is heavy but it is floating on the top of the skin, not really moisturizing. Plus it smells like straight plastic. Anyways, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product, it is stupidly expensive. Go get something else like the Curel cream or the belief moisturizing cream (not the gel version) or anything else. Please guys, I think even cetaphile at the drugstore works better.

Even with moisturizer and a hydrating foundation, my skin still looked dry and lackluster. I have to be careful what I use on my skin because it is very prone to clogging and whiteheads, so I had started layering several lighter weight products to try to moisturize my skin, This cream is like a miracle. First of all, there is no detectable fragrance which I love! It hydrates my skin beautifully, yet does not cause my pores to clog or cause breakouts. Wears beautifully under makeup. I have been using it morning and night since I tried it, and I am going to Sephora today to buy the full size jar. I would give this cream 100 stars if I could, it is that wonderful.

I made the decision to switch the natural skincare products and I’ve had great success with a cleanser, serums, and eye cream, but I’m really struggling with a moisturizer. After reading reviews and doing some research, I thought this one sounded like a good fit but I was a little disappointed in this cream because I found that it sat on top of my skin for most of the day instead of sinking in. It didn’t cause any problems like break outs or irritation but it just made my skin feel sort of sticky and heavy, which I didn’t like. I prefer when my moisturizer absorbs and leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrating but not weighed down. Unlike many of the other users, I didn’t mind the smell very much and I love the ingredients list so I’m bummed that it didn’t work out for me but it just wasn’t a good fit. It’s still worth trying a sample size because it seems to work so well for other people but it just wasn’t compatible with my skin and my preferences.

I have been using it for around 3 months now! I have an almost natural redness to my skin that I have always associated with having very sensitive skin. Like washing my face with just water will make my face red. Even with like the gentle dermatologist recommended CeraVe face wash, my face is red for like 15 minutes afterwards. I have noticed with continued use of this MRC that my face is much less red and irritated by other products. I love that when I wake up my face is even toned and glow-y. My skin is very dry in the winter, and this has helped prevent and get rid of all of my dry patches. I am excited to try the Daily Reviving Concentrate since that smell is citrus so I will likely actually enjoy that smell! My only concern is that this will end up being a winter only product since my skin is so oily in the summer. But I am used to having different products in the summer months than I use for the winter months. The only other important thing I would as about this oil is that if you have any big blemishes coming out, just know this will make them come out much faster but also it will make their life much shorter which is definitely a plus.

I’m obsessed with it and have since repurchased it in the large size. I stopped using it when trying a new product a few months back and quickly regretted the switch and realized what a difference this stuff truly makes to the overall condition of my skin. This product makes my skin brighter, clearer and incredibly soft. It has done wonders for the few facial scars I have as well. It is now without a doubt on my holy grail list.

Not to say they aren’t good, this one is just the best for me. I use it 2-3 times per week, 1 or 2 pumps does the trick. I still have about 1/4 of the bottle left.

Helped get rid of pesky acne scars on my jawline, evened my skin tone, and keeps me from breaking out.

Just a warning for first time users to apply thin layer on your face avoiding the eyes and mouth area because this will cause a mild tingling effect ( proof that it's working on your pores) but will also go away in a few seconds.

After my first use I strongly considered returning because I hate the texture and feel of this product. However I have noticed that it stays in place all day which is rare as I have oily skin. I won't be returning it but I don't think I'll buy it again. I don't like how flaky my skin looks when I use this and the texture is truly awful. I don't understand how it can be oil-free when it feels so oily and siliconey. I'm very torn on this product because it does make my skin look nice, I'm just not a fan of how it applies. I also don't find it buildable at all. Kudos to Tarte for making a tinted primer with SPF that doesn't feel like SPF but this just isn't for me.

I wanted a foundation that wasn’t really full coverage and didn’t look like I was obviously wearing makeup and would also not go “shiny” and settle into fine lines an hour after application. But I wanted all of this in a silicone free formula. This does everything I wanted, blurs imperfections and evens skin tone without looking like makeup, wears beautifully all day, acts as a primer to lock in blush/bronzer/highlighter, and keeps skin perfectly matte. However, the silicone congests my skin and that is why I deducted a star. I apply this with a damp beauty blender which works much better than smoothing onto skin with fingers, spreads a thinner more even amount of product which does help create less congestion. I would pay more to get the same thing without silicone!

I do a lot of experimenting with new skincare and makeup. I have tried dozens of other BB & CC creams, but this champ comes out on top every time. There are two constants in my regimen, this BB and the Ole Henrickson vitamin C Brightening Wipes. I stopped wearing a full face, but I still use this everyday. I can feel my skin asking for it! After many years of use here's what I have to report: Sun damage, wrinkles, uneven skin tone and texture have all been mitigated by this product. It is not a do-all, but it makes my skin happy AF. The SPF is great because it's physical not chemical. It has helped fade old acne scarring and helps my skin to stay young and glowy. My biggest complaint is that it can transfer aggressively if not set properly. You have to give it time to soak in, and I recommend setting it with a translucent powder.

However, I must admit that I have not tried it yet under makeup. I have very oily skin so I usually stick to products specifically targeted for oil control if I'm going to wear makeup. On most days though I am barefaced so I focus more on my skincare routine. I personally find this product to be very smooth and moisturizing. I love how it feels upon application, so much so I wish I could bathe in this cream! It's just so silky and sinks right into my skin leaving it incredibly soft. Honestly I can't stop touching my face when I use this. I'm a skincare junkie and there are a lot of moisturizers I love and use often, but I do find myself reaching for this one the most. If you have dry skin and find that this cream isn't enough, it might be worth trying a thin layer of the YTTP Superberry oil underneath (which is also an excellent product). I have found that these two products work well together when I'm looking for a little more hydration. Again, not something I would personally do if I had to wear makeup (because of my oily skin) but on days when I stay at home and just focus on my skin I've really come to love this stuff. Definitely a holy grail product for me on my no makeup days.

Therefore, I was super excited to try this moisturizer as my skin has become more dry over time, but this unfortunately was not one of my favorites. It’s super expensive, so I expected it to really hydrate and smooth my skin. It’s very light in texture, and my skin sucked it up right away. However after a few seconds my skin felt tight and dry. I think if you had normal to oily skin this would be a great moisturizer to try. However, I have tried much better moisturizers (especially for the price) for dry skin. I ended up returning this after trying it for a week and a half with no luck.

This is incredible for somebody who used to have acne and oiliness and flakiness and blackheads and wrinkles and freckles and sunspots.

I have very sensitive skin and the liquid collagen make me break out. The Sleeping collagen however makes my pores shrink while providing the much-needed moisturization overnight. I apply it either over the Retin-A or I skip the treatment and put the collagen directly on skin every few days to give myself a break. I’ve had zero pimples with doing this. I absolutely cannot believe what a difference it has made in my skin. Almost not a single day goes by without somebody stopping me to tell me I have perfect skin. My secret? I’m a Genius.

I can't say enough amazing things about this sleeping collagen. I started noticing a difference in the quality and smoothness of my skin almost immediately. It has a very velvety texture, so it goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. I use it on my face, neck and decollete. It doesn't have a strong fragrance, which is great for me because of my allergies. If I go to bed with a pimple, I'll wake up and my blemish is gone! I absolutely love this GENIUS line. I also use the anti-aging face wash, which is great.

I ordered a bunch of the Biossance brand and got this as a sample to hold me until the package arrived and now I'm wondering if I made a mistake lol. Anyways, my skin is very picky and delicate and I had a bit of sensitivity the first 2 nights I used this where I wasn't sure if it was the right product for me. I'm sure it was the glycolic acid because my skin is not used to chemical exfoliants. My skin would be a bit red and funny looking before going to bed but it would wake up to nice skin. By day 5 it was a whole different story. NO sensitivity after putting it on and walking up to better soon I could ever dream of. So yea. Give this stuff a try if you're interested in the original. A sample size is big enough to tell if you're going to like the product or not and if you DO you will be more than likely purchasing because it is awesome!!..

Great for pairing with a powder SEPHORA COLLECTION Contour Palette, is my choice. The tacky cream helps powder to adhere well. But it will not give you a “flawless look” alone. It will bunch up into lines or wrinkles without other products to have a fill wrinkles.

I got this as a sample and I was hooked. I’ve had skin cancer on my face so sunscreen is important and this has it. This works like camouflage to hide the red. I’ve been using this about two months and it’s not cured my redness issues but it does hide them extremely well when I use it. I don’t wear foundation or tinted moisturizer at all. To use, I wash my face, use a lightweight moisturizer then put this on my face. A little goes a long way and I do a lot of stippling instead of rubbing because I don’t want this to rub in to the point it is not providing camouflage anymore. It looks really green in the jar but when it goes on the red skin, it neutralizes. Then I do my eyebrows and eyes while this dries. My last steps are Contouring, blush and highlighter. My “after” pics show my face without any foundation and only using this cicapair with my regular makeup routine.

Not really a quick, go to product, but it did do a good job of evening out my complexion and minimizing redness. Very dewy finish, and will cling to dry patches or anywhere that you’ve over applied. Also, if you apply too much and just try to massage it in, it will NEVER adjust to your skin tone and just sits on top of it.

I was hoping to be able to use this product just to even out my tone a bit and not have to wear much or any make up. The thing is it just doesn't rub in very well like I assumed a lotion type product would. It kinda stays streaky on your skin and if you rub or touch your face at all it comes off leaving an obvious spot that doesn't match the rest of your face. And you definitely can't wear make up over it. So I can't really wear it alone or under make up so for me this product does not work. I'm pretty disappointed especially for the price. But maybe the other products in this line would work better? I will say it does smell really good, but that was probably the only thing I really liked about this product.

Skin Type Combination",3 stars,"I've been using this for a few months now and I'm glad I waited this long before writing my review. I first ordered the smaller size in August and fell in love with the product. Mind you, the weather was hot and humid and my face was normal to oily, but heavily oily in my t-zone. On the parts of my face that were normal it just felt good on my skin, it didn't dry me out or make me oily. On the oily parts, however, it did have a very ""wet"" look, but this was nothing a little powder couldn't fix. I did notice as the day went on, my face got increasingly more oily, but I just blotted more, and it was fine with me because I actually received compliments on how great my skin looked when I was wearing this. That small jar lasted well over a month and I purchased the full size before running out in October. Since this product did make me more oily than others I've used, I assumed it would be great in winter, when my skin is much more dry. Unfortunately, when winter hit, this product became unusable for me. I'm a Tretinoin user so my skin gets dry in winter and I have a few dry patches I have to moisturize heavily. No amount of moisturizer could prevent this product from sucking every ounce of moisture from my skin, which made no sense as when my skin was more oily the product increased the oil production on my face. I've tried dozens of combinations of moisturizers with this cream and it is just not something I can use when my skin is dry. It works really well on the areas of skin that are ""perfect"" and already balanced. But if you're oily, it will make you look more oily, and if you're dry, it will make you drier.

It looked flawless on my skin and I use airbrush foundation. With the magic cream, with or without primer, my makeup is blotchy, looks thick and doesn’t look greasy, but feels greasy to the touch. Weird, yes, but I’ve had enough and I’m going back to this. I wanted to try the magic cream and wish I had stopped with this since it was so good, but I had to see what the rage for the magic cream was all about. Double the price compared to this and awful.

I've had a hard time finding a face cream or moisturizer that really feels like it gets in there and moisturizes my face instead of just sitting on the surface and looking oily or causing breakouts, something that lasts more than an hour. When I used this product, it had little to no smell and was almost watery upon applying. I don't really condone spending 50 something dollars on something under 2 oz....but I would recommend this to anyone. After using this, I saw and felt an immediate difference in my skin and I fell in love with it, and it lasted just under three days...after using one freaking time. If I had the opportunity and ability to buy this in bulk, I would. I only gave 4 stars because I haven't used it for an extended period of time. Do yourself a favor and try it out, seriously.

The consistency is more like a gel to water and it absorbs within a minute, leaving skin plump and glowy. The smell is incredibly light - as someone who gets sensory headaches, it does not cause any flare ups to use which is delightful. It also NEVER leaves that gross, sticky feel after absorbing - your face dries like you hardly even put a product on it, leaving your skin hydrated and gorgeous. I cannot write enough about it!

This essence plumped my skin up so beautifully it’s unreal... my skin has never felt more soft before. This also ridded me of my pores on my cheeks in about two nights, and has diminished pores on my nose within a week. My trick for the best results is to pour a few drops onto damp palms and then apply to a damp face. I tried with dry hands and dry skin but it felt a bit sticky and didn’t apply as smoothly and evenly as it does with damp skin, and you end up using more product. I start out by gently tapping product over my face and finish off by rubbing in circular motions all over until absorbed. This is the #1 product I would recommend to anyone, even for the price it’s beyond worth it. I’ve been trying to find a product to get rid of pores and this is THE thing to try if you’re looking for the same thing. I swear by Tatcha.

It makes my skin feel dry, tight, red, and borderline painful. I've applied maybe 6 handfuls of this within 30 mins of each other (hoping it'll set in and moisturize) and my skin feels just as dry, and more painful, than as if I didn't put any on to begin with. Definitely don't waste your money if you have dry skin because this is just glorified water with no noticeable benefits.

I got this when I didn’t have the best skincare routine yet, so my skin was very dry, oily, and flaky at the time. Nothing would help my skin texture at, this certainly didn’t help the flakes or anything but it did leave my skin feeling hydrated. I didn’t expect this to be a miracle product to save my skin, but I could tell it would be great if my skin was repaired a bit. I just knew I had to add this into my cart when I went on a skincare shopping binge. And now in combination with other amazing products, I can see the actual benefits from this since my skin has become baby smooth with a soft surface. This hasn’t caused any dryness or breakouts for me. While this is great, I can tell there’s better out there. After a long period, I can feel my skin become oily (and when my skin is oily I feel the slightest itchy/burning feeling) Overall i love it and the cons are tolerable, I just use different moisturizers in my routine to balance it out. I feel like if I used this both morning and night it would eventually irritate my skin.

Used this on a daily, and with a setting spray it lasted almost the whole day with no touch ups. Personally, it’s a little too glowy at times, (because of my combination skin) and I just dab a bit of the CC cream compact powder and my complexion is all set! A great substitute for foundation. Another plus point is that upon removal, my skin looked glowy and healthy! Maybe it’s the serum? Whatever it is, I’m loving it. The only cons is that at first, the consistency feels a little thick, but hey a little goes a long way AND it feels lighter over time.

I normally don’t like a scented skincare product but I do when it’s this good! It’s a thicker creme but not heavy. A little bit goes a long way. You put it on at night and your skin drinks it in. You can almost feel your skin getting softer if that makes sense. By morning, my skin feels and looks fresher, brighter, hydrated and alive!

I’ve tried moisturizers coding $150 that couldn't hydrate my skin as well as this does, and was definitely not natural. I’m going to keep using this until it stops working for me, it’s been over a year and it’s still working perfectly for me.

Because it always gave me a shiny, dewy look I never wore it with makeup, figuring that makeup would melt off, and I typically use either the Confidence in a Gel Lotion with foundation or CC cream in the day depending on how hot it is. I did reas that others used this with makeup and see that now IT Cosmetics is marketing it as a day cream. However, the other day my skin was getting super dry because of the winter so I decided to try it with makeup one evening. It actually had the opposite effect of what I expected. I put foundation (Nars radiant longwear) and setting powder (Hourglass translucent) over it, which when I wear that with the gel lotion gives me a nice, radiant but not shiny finish. The Confidence in a Cream was hydrating for my skin but seemed to suck in all the powder in a weird way that led to an extremely matte finish that I haven't gotten with other moisturizers. It made my skin look dry with makeup. YMMV, definitely test various combinations on your own skin but I'm sticking with night use only.

I was HIGHLY skeptical to try out confidence inna cream. I noticed positive results immediately!! It absorbed into my skin easily and left it feeling dry to the touch, but hydrated. no oily residue, no burning sensation and most importantly, I didn't wake up to a breakout. I used it before bed and morning every day for a week and noticed that my skin just looked better and better every day. 8bmonths later and I finally have skin I am comfortable goingbout in without makeup.

As a fan and user of the Perricone MD line of skin care, I am thrilled to be able to test this neck cream and share my thoughts. First of all, I am a woman of a “certain age” (61, to be exact) and I have the same concerns that all women of my age group do...specifically, sagging skin and loss of elasticity. As someone who works in a youth-obsessed industry, my appearance is critical and something that I strive to nurture and maintain. I have always utilized high-end skin care products, with Perricone MD being one of my go-to brands. Thus, when I received this Perricone MD Neck Treatment, I was psyched to give it a whirl. First impression -- the product is not greasy and does not possess an overpowering fragrance. I’ve been applying it every morning and right before bedtime. A little goes a long way…so although the cream is pricey, it doesn’t take much product to complete an application. The product absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn’t leave a sticky film. To be fair, I have not used this long-term, but only for 2 weeks, however, I can say that I am pleased with the results I’ve seen in such a short span of time. I don’t expect miracles from any cream, serum, or lotion, but this product does exactly what it claims to do – I see a visible difference in the firmness in my jawline and neck area. I would definitely recommend Perricone MD Cold Plasma Sub-D/Neck Treatment. As with all of the Perricone MD products that I’ve invested in, this cream is consistent with the rest of the brand. I know I can always buy Perricone MD with confidence as it performs and provides the desired results!

It was starting to bother me so much I started researching cosmetic surgeries. I've always been told I look 30s but my neck was starting to look 70. I sleep on my side and large breasts which caused very deep lines across my chest. I was embarrassed to wear v neck tops. Within one week of using Perricone Sub D Neck I could see dramatic improvement. 3 weeks later and the lines on my chest are gone. My neck skin is firm and no longer crepey. I apply it along my chin and jawline as well and this area is firm and much more defined. The price is out of my budget but with these results I will cut costs somewhere else to continue having this in my life. I see many people complaining about the smell. IMO it 1st smells like a clean pleasant light citrus scent. After a few moments it does develop a somewhat fishy smell. But it isn't bad. I don't tolerate bad smells well. It's more of a fresh uncooked fish smell rather than a nasty fish odor. I just think of the smell as a positive that it is doing amazing work while I sleep! Worth every penny.

And that's the way it smelled to me 4 or 5 years ago too. Has nothing to do with a formula being changed. Just how my nose works. I wonder if the fish smell is something genetic... kinda like the way some people taste soap when they eat cilantro.,https://www.sephora.com/product/cold-plasma-sub-d-anti-aging-neck-treatment-P270714?icid2=products%20grid:p270714

I work in an office that has the AC blasting all day, bright fluorescent lights and I’m staring at a computer screen for 8 hours straight. My skin starts to feel dry and gets a little blotchy around 10am and basically my skin never looks good when exposed to all of those factors. I got a full size of this product in one of the Christmas bundles (2018) and I have to say- it works. Within 10 minutes of spraying, my skin is plump, dewy and it glows. It’s a fantastic makeup refresher too. It makes my pores look smoother and my makeup look like my skin. It also hydrates around the eyes which is huge for me, because they get so dry from blue light. Lasts me about 6 months.

It doesn’t seem like much is coming out of the bottle because the spritz is so light so I have gone through it so quickly that really only 3 pumps is enough.

I found it to be rather expensive for what it is but the reason I returned it is the smell. I know others find this a plus but I really hated it. It's an earthy, herby smell. Reminds me of patchouli (which I also loathe); not what I want to smell like. But if you're a fan of those scents then this is worth a try. It does leave a really pretty sheen on the skin. The spray is ultra fine which I liked and the packaging is gorgeous! I really wish I'd enjoyed the smell.

The smoothness, glow, brightness, even tone, even texture, clarity, and suppleness was unbelievable. My skin has NEVER looked better. I do this treat routine 3-4 a week. For my daytime route I mix 2 drops of the Virgin Marula oil to my face cream. I hate heavy, oily, scented, sticky products on my face during the day. I want light products and this is it. It sinks into your skin so it is invisible but the results are dramatic! You won’t regret this purchase!!

I noticed a difference around week two of consistent - daily use. Yes, daily, twice a day, as per instructions. If you want to see results from any product, you must use it as directed. I got used to the stickiness (it's very mild) nothing to be concerned about - I did notice the makeup stays on longer. I used it every day, in the morning and at night. I did not use anything else. Keep in mind, just like any medicinal cough syrup may not taste good at first, you get used it, and with consistent use, it works - so will most products if you follow directions. Apply the same technique to skincare products and you might be pleasantly surprised.

It’s still hydrating and leaves my skin feeling noticeably plump. While it is fragranced, the fragrance is subtle and not overly sweet. I can’t attest to long-term anti-aging effects, but suspect (based on ingredients) potential effects would involve minor brightening and hydration-related line minimization. Regardless, it leaves my skin feeling amazing and looking beautifully dewy throughout the day. Those who dislike dewiness or deal with excess shine may not enjoy.

I was told this product is good for dry skin because it’s an oil. It is very watery like the name, but I can not use it because it contains alcohol, which my skin is allergic to. Every time I use it, it makes my cheeks red and itchy. I stopped after using it three times and the red stopped the following day. It is a good product if your skin is not sensitive, but for me, it’s a ripoff for the price. So be aware of ingredients before purchase.

The consistency is similar to Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Day Moisture or clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion With Pump 4.2oz or LA MER The Moisturizing Lotion. It truly is a lotion consistency. I’ve purchased it a couple of times It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It made a slight difference in my skin’s evenness of tone and texture. In my opinion, you need a serum, peel, or exfoliant for those results, but it didn’t cause any adverse reactions. No breakouts. No sensitivity. No obnoxious fragrance. I’d recommend and a more budget friendly, but still high quality moisturizer.

Unfortunately, I noticed bumps on my forehead and under my chin the morning after using this oil. If something doesn’t agree with my skin, I either breakout or start to have textured skin with underneath the skin bumps. There are other more affordable vitamin c products that work better for me, so I don’t think I’ll using it on my face to see if there is an adjustment period. I received this as a points sample, and I’ll use this up as a body oil!

I had a really bad hormonal imbalance around the holidays so I broke out and couldn't help but pick and pop the pimples. A few months later and I finally decided to give this a try and omggg the results were amazing. My face is moisturized but not greasy, the dark spots are slowly fading, I also had dry cracked peeling sensitive lips (really gross like as if I was doing meth) used a humidifier but it only dried them out worse, nothing worked for months! I also had a bald patch on my eyelashes from curling them daily then one day I got too aggressive and ripped off a bunch! I noticed after a few months of applying this oil to my lips and eyes as serum that my lashes have grown so fast and they curl up now! My lips are always moisturized, I don't have to reapply my lip chap! The price is justified because it literally did wonders for me

I used this for a few days and had a massive breakout that took me close to a month to clear up. It was the only thing in my skincare routine that could possibly have done that to me. I decided to give it one more shot earlier this week and used it for just one night. The next day, even after cleansing my face in the morning, I had a bunch of small bumps on my chin and above my mouth that I knew were going to explode into pimples. I could also tell that my skin was producing excess sebum. That night I used a couple of tea tree-containing products and Murad’s Acne Control Clarifying Mask in an attempt to head off what seemed to be a massive breakout, and fortunately that did the trick. But the Vitamin C Rose Oil went in the trash. Never again.

I did find it cool that it starts out white and then blends in. You can use your fingers but i think a brush is better because your fingers will feel sticky after application. It leaves a radiant finish but Unfortunately it isn’t the best on covering redness and acne. You will need to put on an extra layer if you want to cover redness or acne. You get a lot of product for the price.

During the winter my skin has a tendency to feel super tight, and then in a few hours, look super oily with sliding makeup. I sprayed this on with few expectations and noticed that my pores looked smaller throughout the day, there seemed to be less oil excretion, my makeup was staying put, and my skin felt comfortable to wear. An added bonus is this is refreshing and smells so good. I also love the packaging. A huge pet peeve is when I put bottles in my bag and the top comes off ( especially when the bottles are spray bottles). The top stays on so well and is a pleasure for travel use.

If you read the ingredients you can see that not only does it have alcohol (doesn’t matter that it’s naturally derived, that is a super drying ingredient), it’s all things that you can access easily and thus this toner is easily dupe-able vía DIY. It’s just water, alcohol, and essential oils like rosemary and mint. By the way, the rosemary and mint can be really astringent and harsh, especially when you get to the end of the bottle (which wastes a lot of product). I also don’t like the packaging - the glass bottle is really heavy and the lid/sprayer are a weird material that feels really cheap. Please just make this yourself. Can’t believe this is $49!

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"After being introduced to a soothing mist that my esthetic nurse friend gave me a sample of, I wrestled within myself on whether or not I should incorporate something like that in my skincare routine. Also, I remember years ago that an esthetician I knew years ago would use one of Dermalogica's additives (I think it was the Clearing Additive) in my treatments and I loved it. Before using the soothing mist, I wouldn't even give any consideration about buying something like this as I would have deemed it as unnecessary. Also, the Dermalogica Additive provided one of the best experiences I've had during a facial (other than the pops, of course). So, after using mostly fragrance-free or no-added fragrance products in my skincare routine (as well as my husband complaining that some of the products did have an aversive scent. I don't blame him as I felt the same way), I found myself missing that sensory element of smelling spa-like aromas. Also, I consider my skincare routine to be a slice of time that I have for myself. Ultimately, I bought a bottle of this stuff as it turned out to be gentle on my skin (I made sure to test it out first by spritzing it each time I went to a Sephora), which is great because it does list ""parfum"" as part of its ingredients. Also, the sprayer produces very fine mists that feels like a true moisture boost (kind of like a light humidifier feeling) as opposed to a feeling like small drops landed on my skin & falling down on my face like tears. I don't find myself fanning my face after using this. The elements of a great spray mechanism, soothing to my face, & the spa-like sensory experience are the top reasons why I decided to buy this. The fact that it can be easily purchased at popular store like Sephora is an added bonus. Is this product ""extra""? Perhaps. However, I do find the sensory experiences of things, especially something I do every single day, important as it does give me a sense of calm, as well as provide nice added moisture.

My redness disappeared day one. I bought the full-size immediately. I have very oily skin but and need to use lighter moisturizers (currently Clinique Dramatically Different AM/Tarte Drink of H2O PM) and this product does not add stress to my skin or interfere with other products. My skin is softer and texture has improved. I was previously using La Mer The Concentrate for redness and texture issues and I will never go back as long as this product is available. It is twice as effective and three times less expensive!

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"This product is truly amazing. I got two samples from previous Sephora orders and then bought the product. I have oily to combination skin. When I first used the sample packet, I had several hormonal/ stress cystic acne spots along my lower jawline on both sides. There were two bigger, more painful bumps on my right side. I did my normal skin care routine and used the genius collagen calming relief instead of my regular nighttime cream. When I woke up, my acne was noticeably less red and the bumps were smaller. My skin felt softer and more smooth. I was super impressed. I used my second sample the next night, only using half the packet (a lot of product in the packet and a little goes along way), had the same results again. The acne was again less painful and red then when I had gone to bed. I do have some cheek redness that didn’t appear to be reduced by the cream at that time or in uses since then. However the fact that it made my painful cystic acne better overnight makes up for it. The cream is thick while still feeling light on your finger tips. It feels very smooth when applying it to your face and you can almost feel your skin drink it in. My skin will breakout if a product is too heavy for it/ doesn’t like a product and I haven’t had any issues. A little truly goes a long way so I would use a pea sized amount for the face and neck and add more if needed.

In those times, all I would do to try and calm my skin is cooling my skin and aloe. However, this cream noticeably soothed my skin in a few hours. I'm so happy they came out with this product because not only can I use this as a semi-regular moisture boost, but I can also keep it in my bag for those panic moments.

As soon as I put this on and the rest of my SK-II products, my skin just immediately looks and feels better. My husband compliments me all the time that my skin looks really good. It says to use twice a day but I only use it once to make it last a little longer. Also, it does not feel greasy at all, in my opinion. It's supposed to prevent signs of aging long term so I'm more curious of how my skin will be after a year or so of using this.

I have pretty good skin- it leans dry, with a few minor aging concerns, but I have no major sensitivities or skin conditions. This cream is such a treat to use- the texture is velvety and my skin is left feeling similarly velvety after application...it just melts magically into my skin. I have definitely noticed an overall improvement in brightness, tone, fine lines, and general vibrancy. I'm generally pretty skeptical when it comes to the super pricey skincare lines, but this stuff seems to deliver promised results, and a little bit does go a long way. Which is good, because the price on this is a killer. I love this stuff so much, but there is no way I can afford to make this part of my regular routine.

I love the product for what it is meant for but would never purchase this as a straight up moisturizer. I do not think this has done or will do anything to benefit the moisture barrier of my skin. It is filled with fragrance which I don't like in my skincare products. I like the illuminating effect it leaves on the skin though which is why I still am giving it a good review. I don't find Glam Glow products to be designed so much to benefit skin and more to appear pretty and trendy. You pay a high price for mediocre ingredients and a ton of un necessary fragrance. If you are looking for a nice glow in the summertime this looks great on its own or under a light coverage moisturizer.

It’s true that the smell is strong and kind of sicky sweet but I don’t notice much past applying it. I can’t speak for how this does under heavy foundation, because I use it under a light foundation/tinted moisturizer for daily wear. I look like death on a cracker some mornings before I do my makeup and as soon as I put this on with my foundation brush, it’s an instant improvement. I look more awake immediately. The light reflecting particles help for around the eye and on good areas of your skin. I like the tube and I’m not looking forward to what looks like a jar when I buy this full-size. Please offer a little tube I can buy again! I honestly like this better for under the eyes than my regular concealer which is frankly just too drying and cakes up. This helps keeps my skin moisturized so I really like it.

I layer SK-2 Essence at least 5-7 times both morning end evening. First layer, I use cotton pad, not a cotton ball. I highly recommend their own cotton or Cle De Peau, Decorte, Chanel. Swipe the whole face with gently circular motion. Then the rest of 5-6, I use my hands, press like into my skin. Skin will be dewy, clear and plump. I get all the wonderful results as I wanted for the mature skin. First one or two weeks, I got pimples but This symptom is normal because the skin is changing into good.

I've been repurchasing SKII essence for years and it honestly makes my skin glow. not sold on how effective it is on shrinking pores...but I've stopped using it here and there for several months at a time and my ski. just doesnt look as... nice. it is rather hard to describe just how it makes my skin look better, but it really does. I have purchased a much cheaper ""dupe"" from cosrx and if it works my wallet will be very happy. if it doesnt, I will return to my tried and true SKII.

Unlike any other moisturizer this one gets absorbed by my skin easily. I can’t tolerate synthetic fragrances on moisturizers and this product doesn’t contain any perfume which I think is healthier for skin. Although some people may not be big fan of the smell but I am okay with it... I would say it is a bit pricey but I am definitely buying again.

I'm astounded. This is just overpriced stinky water with parabens in it. Sure this is nice and soft and does an ok job clearing your skin, but it's definitely a little drying. Keep in mind, it also makes your skin create a dependency on it. If you use this for a month and stop cold turkey, your skin is going to look horrible and patchy for a week before returning to normal, so unless you're planning on buying this forever, I'd say take a pass. Google SK-II dupes if you're really into galactomyces ferment filtrate. My personal favorite is Manyo Factory's Galactomy Niacin Essence, but Secret Key and Missha both have their own galactomyces ferment filtrate first essences for a quarter of the price. If you don't think you're savvy enough to purchase on the k-beauty market, Sephora has two decent and decently priced ferment essences available: Fresh's Black Tea Kombucha Antioxidant Essence (saccharomyces ferment filtrate) and Innisfree's Fermented Soybean Firming Essence (bacillus ferment extract). Obviously these aren't the same as galactomyces but it does a comparable job.

I used to buy the Laneige (lower-end sister brand to AMOREPACIFIC) of the same cushion compact and was so bummed when I found out Sephora wasn't carrying it anymore. Was extatic to hear that the AMOREPACIFIC product was a very similar product as I have pretty sensitive and acne prone skin and product change-ups (especially with makeup) have notoriously not gone well for me. This product is fantastic and although a little on the pricer side, comes with two cushion packages so double the product you would expect. Overall I don't wear anything other than skin care on my face most days, but this is the easiest to always carry in my pride for any last minute plans and is my go to!

It also gives you a hydrated skin look and glow. Lastly, cover uneven skin tone like some redness. Cons: This does not come of easy from skin. This will require a liquid make up remover and liquid face cleaners and other products to make sure is removed. This product actually has caused me to break out with in the one week of use and after a month and I have a lot small pimples and blackheads. I wanted to clean the sponge which was difficult. I started to press on a towel and saw all the product that stays in the sponge. I tried cleaning as often since I worry the sponge with old product causes the pimples. Lastly, after a month the product in the cushion is almost running out but if you flip it and see the corners their is a lot of product left. Once I finish this product I might not buy again. I don't want to ruing my skin and be in a cycle of covering the pimples and making the pimples worse. But.. yeah I still sadly likes this product.

Skin Type Normal",4 stars,"I bought this in shade 102 which says it's for neutral to cool tones and it leans a little more neutral than cool. I'm an exact match to Cream in Hourglass Vanish Liquid Foundation, but I can make this work and I'm willing to do that for such high SPF. I have sensitive combination skin and I felt that this looked great after the initial application. Halfway though the day it started to become very obvious. I do weird things when testing new makeup to see what will happen, so I sprayed my face with water and used a tissue to pat dry. To my amazement it revived everything and it went on to last the rest of the day with no further issues. Before washing my face for the night (13 hours wear time) I used a wipe and there was quite a bit that came off, so it really stayed on well thought the day. It didn't seem to transfer to any clothing or my baby (he likes to pat my face). For me, this is great. I live in WA state so I don't worry about this getting weird and starting to transfer on super misty days. I also travel to CA, HI, and FL several times a year. I'd be using a refreshing spray in CA anyways, but might be able to skip it in FL and HI. It's winter so can't say if it'll melt in hot temps, but I suspect it'll be okay. Bottom line, if you're very pale with a cool skin tone there are very, very few options for high SPF products (which is insane). This specific color is not part of the Color iq database for whatever reason. But if you match to Cream in Hourglass, or are around NW15-20 in MAC this isn't exactly perfect, but it's close enough it's worth trying.

To use as a cleansing oil , i warm about 7 or 8 drops between my palms and then massage it into my skin for about 2 minutes . ring out a warm wash cloth and lay it over your face and take some deep breaths as it cools then gently wipe the oil off. rinse the rag well and wipe one more time then either pat dry or air dry. when i wake up the next morning my skin is glowing and not dry or oily. has improved my blackheads since oil dissolves oil.

I've always been a little skeptical of oils since the ones I've tried in the past haven't really worked out, but after about 2 weeks of using this, I actually see a difference in my face! I have a moderately oily T zone and very dry cheeks and this oil has definitely done a great job of balancing that. I especially see a difference in my complexion, which has been HUGE for me. I've always had some underlying redness and this has smoothed this out. My skin is more even, looks more fresh and in general is much more healthy. 10/10 will definitely keep using this.

I've only started using it in the winter, so I'm using it for a little extra hydration under my regular nighttime moisturizer and SPF during the day. I think it will be my sole moisturizer for the summer. It sinks in well for me without leaving my skin too sticky. It does feel slightly tacky, but that goes away with a lotion on top or given enough time. The scent is kind of sweet/candied, but that dissappates pretty quickly, too. My major disappoinment with it, is that it's hard to get the residual last bit out, which is a bummer given the price. I appreciate the bottle being glass, but I wish the mouth was a bit wider to access the dregs. I also have had a couple minor break outs while using this, but I'm not sure I can attribute it to the moisturizer.

I understand purging with good products- but as a frequent long time retinoid user I understand the concept of “the purge.” This wasn’t it, just made it more problematic. Always always always get samples, even if other reviewers have similar skin woes. What works for someone may not work for you even with the same skin concerns.

I know it was the process of retinization, and you’re supposed to just push through, but the redness, peeling, flaking, inflammation, and dryness was so intense I decided it was not worth it and went back to using an AHA instead. My skin was so dry that I couldn’t go through my whole 12 hour work day without having to use another layer of moisturizer and it looked dull and awful. Oils had never worked for my skin in the past and would always cause breakouts but my skin was no longer producing natural oils so I decided to try this one as I had a sample of it. This oil saved my skin, literally. After three days of use morning and night on top of moisturizer, my skin is no longer peeling or dry and the redness has almost gone away entirely. I am GLOWING and I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin. There is a faint hemp scent but it goes away quickly and I don’t mind it anyway. It’s so lightweight yet nourishing, I can’t say enough good things about this which is why I quickly bought the full size. I think the online ingredients list needs to be updated because I did not see fractionated coconut oil listed on the box of my product, or else I would not have bought it.

However, the night cream I could not use- so I had to buy a separate night cream. Emermald CBD has solved all my problems. My skin glows- it is so soft. Redness has been reduced.

Probably wouldn't use it as much in the summer unless I need to treat irritation, since even though it's not heavy, I think it would be too much, so I also wouldn't necessarily recommend it to those with oily skin- I've never had an issue with it causing congestion, but I'm not acne-prone, so I can't say for sure. Overall, I'd still recommend it to most!

But onto the balm -- it IS a balm; so it's the last part of a bedtime skincare drill. It's amazing. I have sensitive, dry skin to start with, but being ""of a certain age"" -- sadly, your skin changes with the onset of the big M -- it's even drier. This balm gives my skin an overnight drink. I'm prone to rosacea and can't speak yet to whether it calms flare-ups. Thankfully, with a constellation of a 2-step cleanse, a emollient toner, some Ordinary products -- my pH barrier is healthier than it's been in years. This is a great addition as we head into winter.

Skin is supple and hydrated. It is great for every night use. I can't recommend this product enough if you suffer from sensitive or dry skin. To add, REN is also pregnancy-safe which, although I am not pregnant, is really great to know as it really confirms them gentleness and cleanness of their products. An overall great brand.

Things I don’t love, it can congest my skin a little, leaves skin looking/feeling greasy at first, and has some questionable ingredients. I really wish this gave better results firming my skin. I had switched to this from the lotus youth preserve when I felt signs of aging appear. I’m sticking with it for now, but still on the hunt for my dream cream. Using resurfacing night gels and weekly masks helps combat the congestion. I rounded down from 3.5 stars that I wanted to give because for the price I think it should be better at firming and have cleaner ingredients.

The Corset Moisturizer has a mild fragrance, a luxurious creaminess, and a lovely finish. It is compatible with sunscreens and foundations. My jawline, parentheses and neck wrinkles are more firm than when I started the product. And my skin is nicely moisturized even in the Colorado aridity. I do not look close to 70! The Rose Moisturizer is a lovely alternative some days. It smells lightly like an English garden and 'plumps' my skin as though I am in a place with actual humidity! If you are aging without facial surgery, these two moisturizers and related products will certainly keep your skin looking and feeling elegant. Ever open to alternatives, I tried a few Kiehl's products for several weeks, but felt I was losing ground, so returned to fresh!

I'm just not convinced that I could feel or see much of the firming effect in the time I used it.

Skin Type Dry",3 stars,"I received this Black Tea Corset Cream as a birthday gift. It is a nice, smooth, pleasant skin cream. It smells good, but not strong or perfumey. It works pretty well as a moisturizer. But the “Corset” part is nowhere to be found. A lot of the Fresh products I’ve tried are like this: Pleasing to use, but no quick results. And in my case, I use it almost exclusively on my neck. Sagging or loose skin and loss of elasticity are problems only on my throat and upper eyelids, so I use Caudalie serum and La Mer Cream on my face. For several weeks, I’ve faithfully used the “corset” cream on my neck and jawline. For the bold claim implied by its name, and the price, I really expected at least minor results by this time. But this corset ain’t pulled tight enough! I don’t even feel a minor, brief tightening or firming sensation when it goes on my skin. I feel nothing but a fairly light-textured moisturizer. The biggest disappointment is that the skin on my neck looks looser and less elastic than it did more than a month ago! I gave it three stars for the nice scent, smooth texture, and moisturizer. But the main attraction—that ‘face corset’ feeling and results are completely absent so far. I know there are much better skin firming neck and décolleté creams out there. But since this is a brand that, to me, makes milder and gentler products with slower results, I will be patient, hope for any firming of my throat, and finish the jar. With luck, Corset Cream is just a late bloomer that takes a long time to kick in. If it doesn’t start tightening skin, I’ll be heading over to Algenist, Perricone, or PTR. If this Black Tea Corset Cream doesn’t start showing any firming results, I will not purchase this (glad it was a gift) nor try the eye cream that goes along with it.

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"This is an honest review! I’m a skincare junkie but I never ever write reviews but I’m trying to get in the habit of it in hopes my opinion on skincare products I’ve tried can help people out w/ similar skin to mines. Skin type - Sensitive, combo-dry but mostly dry, acne prone and I get red acne marks after a blemish goes away. First essence I’ve ever tried and and I have no regrets! Currently finishing up my 1st bottle that lasted 3 months almost 4 & I purchased a 2nd bottle already w/ my VIB discount. Was never really into the essences & toners but my skin barrier was completely damaged & dry from all of the chemical exfoliants and harsh skincare I’ve used. I finally came to the conclusion that I needed to stop w/ all of that & just stick to repairing & hydrating my skin. I recently started breaking out pretty bad again during August & w/ this new skincare routine I’ve been sticking to of just specifically repairing & hydrating my skin has been a life changer! I also always make sure to check ANY ingredients list I use in a skincare product. I go for more simplicity yet effective w/ really great ingredients that I know can still help improve my skin. Pros - - SIMPLE & GREAT INGREDIENTS - Super hydrating - I noticed it has help improved my dehydrated skin - Lightweight for layering - Calms down redness & irritation - I’ve seen my red acne marks from previous breakouts healing & fading faster. This includes current active blemishes I get - I’ve noticed a difference in my skin barrier repairing but I also have to give that credit to other skincare products I’ve been using in conjunction w/ this Cons - - Pricey - It’s required to use the cotton rounds w/ this essence but I don’t use the cotton rounds so imo it’s a waste for me but I give them away to my sister who uses them for makeup removal (I use my hands for this essence & a patting motion)

I find I get a lot more use out of a smaller amount of product that way. This has been a life saver for my skin that does not want to stay moisturized even with layers of serum, moisturizer, face oil, and sunscreen. If you’re doing everything else you need to do for your skin and still feeling dry then definitely add an essence like this one to your routine

I bought this 1.5-2 years ago with a gift card I received for my birthday or something after doing A LOT of research (I bought the 3 pack actually) and used it all until it was empty, loved the way my skin looked! I have since then repurchased the 3 pack a couple more times (dying inside every time as it’s $100-but thankfully it lasts a couple months at a time) this time I bought strictly this night time treatment and let me tell you this is the star of that whole set!! I notice a difference the first morning after I used it! My skin looks brighter and happier and evened out!!! I find I break out A LOT less and it’s just an overall amazing product! I apply this every night and if I remember correctly the bottle lasts a couple months. It can pill, but I find it doesn’t if you let it dry before applying moisturizer. I’m not a huge makeup wearer, and when I do i prefer sheer and glowy products, so this helps my skin look the best it can so my sheer products look flawless!

Whenever I would put moisturizer on afterward it would pill up and leave little flakes all over my face. If the pilling was due to too much product being applied then the pump should be designed to dispense the proper amount, as a single pump would usually give me more than enough to cover face and neck. I didn’t find this to do anything for me besides make my skin flake. Smells weird and overall a big no for me.

Unfortunately for the first hour after I apply I notice my redness is aggravated and hyper sensitive. That being said...I did notice a difference in the plumpness of my skin and a lasting dewy effect throughout the day. I wish it was more suited for sensitive skin, but it does reduce fine lines and plump regardless of the immediate redness side effect.

Additionally, it results in beautiful makeup. I am 21 years old and I have combination leaning more towards dry skin (occasionally.) Thence my skin care routine has one central intention: controlling oil,minimizing pores while supplying moisture and nutrients equally as well. I have had a difficult time finding a moisturizer that provided my skin with balance, moisture, and rebuilding properties. I tried the suggested “water based” moisturizers and my skin would get very irritated by the high concentrations of hylauronic acids. I tried the la Mer moisturizing gel cream and it worked beautifully, but it was not in my budget. Finally, I stumbled upon this product while in Sephora with my sister. I tried it and needless to say, I saw results instantly. My redness disappeared. I know longer felt dry and uncomfortably in my skin. Finally, my skin looked and felt like actual glass. I used it in conjunction with the Sunday Riley vitamin C oil and serum and the caudalie beauty elixir. I didn’t have to wear any foundation for the next couple of days because my skin loved that combination SO much. I use this moisturizer as directed and in very small doses (which I LOVE) and my skin has never felt more controlled, calm, and rebuilt. Furthermore, it is SO soft. I will always buy this moisturizer it is a TOTAL game changer. Combo people, do not be afraid to use this cream I have experienced no greasiness or irritation.

A recent series of events led me to a point where the bottom half of my face was burning, dry, irritated, and peeling, yet still breaking out at the same time. I didn't even know that was possible. Every single thing I would put on my face to try and fix it, wound up stinging and irritating me even further, including Skinfix barrier , Dr. Jart Ceramidin, Caudalie SOS, Biossance Omega Repair, Korres Hydra Biome, Korres 24hr Moisturizer. On a return trip to Sephora I saw this sitting on the shelf and requested a sample, which the Sephora employee tried hard to persuade me against. Evidently, they don't think any better of it in store than the reviewers on here do. This cream quite literally saved my skin. It was the ONLY cream not to further sting and irritate me, it visibly improved the redness and dryness with each application, and over the course of a week and a half, has brought my skin to near perfection. I had backed off all my normal skin care and used Ice, exclusively, all over my face twice a day. The skin that wasn't irritated looks healthier, more hydrated, brighter, smoother, and clearer. In my experience this cream: -absorbs very effectively, leaving skin plump and bouncy -doesn't leave a trace of oiliness/greasiness behind, even on oily prone areas -smells kind of like cherries, which does not bother me one bit -does NOT cause any breakouts, even seems to improve existing ones I applied a slightly thicker layer to the irritated areas, and a thinner one to the rest of my skin. I found that pressing it in versus rubbing seemed to make it easier to spread. I will be purchasing the full sized version and making this a permanent addition to my routine. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

Not for 20 or 30 year olds. I hope it’s around when we get dry.

I know this cream doesn't work for everyone based on the reviews, but I can't help but love it. I love the scent (not strong at all to me) and the thickness. Believe me, I didn't want to love a $65 moisturizer and I keep trying out the samples that come in my beauty boxes, but I just keep coming back to this cream. If I don't use it my face drys up like the Mojave. My dry, sensitive face loves this cream and I will just have to keep purchasing because I haven't found anything better.

I can deal with most cosmetics as far as scent but this smells awful to me, like putrid cocoa butter? I'm not really sure how to describe the smell but it sticks around for awhile. I used to be an oily mess & enjoyed the SR Tidal Cream for a really healthy glow & was hoping to get that from this. I've used a few times, have not broken out yet but it does make my face feel itchy so between that, the scent & the fact that it's not as hydrating as I need I wouldn't purchase a full size. I could tell after first use it would likely cause a breakout by the way it my me itch. I'll stick with my Kiehl's Ultra to battle my dry skin & rosacea as have not found anything better to date. I'm 48 & have tried everything under the sun for dry, sensitive skin..this is not a replacement for my Kiehls. It is a heavier cream that you may enjoy if you don't have sensitivity & have normal or combo skin. might be too heavy for very oily skin imo. It did soak quickly into my skin. Will save the rest of sample for elbows, feet, etc.

I scooped a small amount up and rubbed it into the back of my hand. The back of my hand then smelled like burnt play dough. I frowned, then smelled the product in the container to re-process what I had just smelled. Again—a whiff of burnt play dough. After thoroughly rubbing this cream into the back of my hand, the back of my hand remained shiny and slightly sticky. It began to mildly tingle after a few minutes. I couldn’t wait to wash my hands and I decided not to put this on my face.

I'm 37, and it took me until about a year ago to finally discover a slew of products and a skincare routine that worked. (I also had to discover that my skin hates SPF and most moisturizers are too heavy for my skin, and organic skincare breaks me out.) The one product I cannot live without is this. I noticed a difference in my skin immediately. It's more hydrated, brighter, and the tone and texture has changed dramatically. Once my skin changed for the better, I stopped using the Miracle Water for about a month. I noticed a difference. My skin started reverting back to how it was before. This is a Holy Grail product for me. I have to have it.

If we could have a fragrance free option for the girls... I’ll be ALL OVER IT!! Did i mention the packaging is super modern and cute?!

I have sensitive combo skin and it can be difficult for me to find something I like that works. With this being a gel moisturizer, I thought it would be great. I read the reviews and thought, oh good there are others with similar scenarios that this has worked for.....NO. This is terrible. It is so heavily fragranced I couldn’t stand to put it on my face. It smells like straight up conditioner. After a couple uses I started to notice large acne under my skin that started to peak through. I’m not normally acne prone unless it’s that time of the month. After all the hassle of that this still didn’t even bring moisture to my skin. It felt nice going on but it’s like my skin needed more and this didn’t have that. I was shocked as to what it did to my skin. Its safe to say I RETURNED this product.

I thought this would be one of the best moisturizers ever because of the ingredients and the price but I was dead wrong. I received this in a Herbivore sample package, “Glow and Hydrate” with the rose mist, glow mask and the Phoenix oil. I apply my oil after my moisturizer since I have sensitive, dry skin. I have tried mixing it with the moisturizer and applying it before my moisturizer but I just get better results applying the oil after the rest of my skin care regimen. No matter what, this moisturizer just piled and flaked off of my face! I hate it when a moisturizer does that because I feel an intense need to wash it off, IMMEDIATELY! It also smells like whiskey? Very odd. I wanted to love it but I don’t like it at all. I am glad that I tried this sample before committing to the full size. I loved the rest of the items I received, though. I love Herbivores oils. I use them in place of moisturizer at night time. I have currently been using the Dr Jart spf cicapair moisturizer during the day. For a better version of this, I would suggest the Sweet Chef Moisture Boost! That is the best moisturizer that I have ever tried!!! Sweet Chef is owned by glow recipe and is sold at Target and is a clean skin care line!!! :) Loooove their kale hydrating mask!! The only downfall with the moisture boost is that it doesn’t contain any sunscreen.

I actually threw it in the trash then realized I could use it as a foot balm and at least not waste it. I know that there are rave reviews about this moisturizer but it definitely wasn’t for me. If you like thick and something that smells like the cold creams of old, it may be great for you. I’m inmy 60’s, used to have oily skin, now dry.

I took a blow across the mouth that opened a gash right through the full thickness of my lip, and I’ve lived with it for over 40 years. About two months ago, I picked up a jar of Gel de La Mer from Sephora (tyvm VIB Rouge!), and have been using it as directed every day. Not only is my face smooth and hydrated, the scar is now softer, smoother, much lighter, and much less noticeable. I’m happy to show before/after pics to give you an idea of the difference this product has made: the pic of me in the gray sweater is from 12/11/2017, the one in the black fleece was taken 1/13/2020.

The biggest positive however, is that it did not react negatively to my skin. It did provide the moisture needed without being greasy or sticky and it sunk into my skin quite well. Didn't break me out, but really didn't do much either. A little goes a long way and I'm just now finishing the jar. Im just glad I didn't pay full price for this and cant imagine how I'd feel if I had and received these results... Another thing to mention if its worth mentioning is that i mixed this in the morning with my SPF and it mixed and sat on my skin very well!

I’m also acne prone and the gel version has never caused me to breakout. I don’t like the prices of the La Mer products or how strong their fragrance is, but it has been a lifesaver for me many times. I’d recommend trying it or getting samples first if you can just because of the price and everyone’s skin is unique.

This is certainly luxurious. It smells and feels amazing, and doesn’t seem to aggravate my seb derm or break me out. Skin certainly feels very smooth and hydrated throughout the day. A lot of skincare junkies will drag jar packaging, but from all the research I’ve done, the preservatives in the formula will more than protect against bacterial growth, and I bought extra spatulas online to avoid dunking my fingers. It’s obviously very expensive, so I bought the large during the VIB sale to maximize value. I really like it, but once I get through this jar I may continue searching for something closer to the $100 range.

This moisturizer is meant for acne prone or oily skin that can't take heavy product in warmer climate. With that being said, I'm one of the few that hated the original formula! It literally did nothing for me so I just used the original in the winter and skipped La Mer in warmer weather bc my skin couldn't take it. However, this new formula works wonders and, I can truly say, it feels like the lighter equivalent of the original! After just one use my skin is completely smooth, the few bumps I had disappeared, and my skin was so soft, I couldn't stop touching it, with the back of my hand of course! There is a technique to using all La Mer moisturizers and the little spoon it comes with will help ensure you don't use too much at once. I also only use as a night cream bc #1) you should be using a moisturizer with SPF in the day time and #2) you will get clogged skin if you use this under the sun!!

Do I think it is worth the price, though? Absolutely not. It's not especially luxurious feeling, it hasn't changed the way my skin looks, and it's not anything world rocking. If you presented it to me without the name, I'd expect to pay $20 for a jar. You're just paying for the branding, really, and, to me, that's just not enough.

During the day, my skin wouldn't become as greasy. I am positive this product helped regulate/calm my sebum production. Using once daily on my face and neck, one bottle lasted me around 2 months. It has a light texture, so it may not be enough moisture for those with dry skin, but is a supple amount for those with oily skin. It has not clogged my pores or caused any adverse irritation. I am very satisfied with this product and will be purchasing another bottle soon!

If you had a light case of dry skin this could be the miracle moisturizer of your life. If you have really dry and flaky spots, I would not rely on one application. I had such high hopes.

Sometimes I even put it on a second time after it has absorbed into my skin. It has significantly improved the dryness of my cheeks and forehead. I do avoid putting it on my nose as I do tend to be oily there and can be prone to breakouts if I overdo the moisturizing on my nose. But It had been great for my most dry/alligator parts of my face.I have also added a drop to my foundation and it has worked well for me in that reguard as well. This product has worked very well for me!

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"REVIEW: “B” Oil is a thick, earthy smelling oil that is a rich golden green color. Don’t mind the smell and color ladies, they dissipate and absorb quickly. These colors and earthy fragrance let’s you know you are getting quality oils that have not been over processed. “B” Oil absorbs quickly on clean skin and does it’s best work at night when your body repairs and rebuilds during sleep. Not all of The Ordinary products are for every skin type but, ”B” Oil is a game changer for all skin types. Use a few drops directly on clean skin and/or combine with your final step moisturizer. My skin absorbs “B”Oil so quickly. I add “B”Oil to my “Buffet” + Copper Peptide and to my final step moisturizer at night where “B”Oil does it’s best work. A little goes a long way! RESULTS: Strange Women are asking me where and what I’m having done to my facial skin! My face glows with health not the slick oiliness I’m used to! Just a heathy glowing skin that produces less oil in my T zone (smaller pores because these pores aren’t full of excess sebum blackheads). My lines and crepey skin is much smoother because it’s actually hydrated. If I found out The Ordinary was discontinuing “B” Oil I would buy cases of the product and store it in a dark, cold undisclosed location. BACKGROUND: I’ve only used products sold at dermatology clinics, until now. I was gifted some The Ordinary products and was shocked by the improvements in my skin in such a short time. I have mature, dehydrated and VERY oily skin. It is difficult to find skin care in this category. I never used skincare oils because of my extremely oily skin even though I knew it would help my dehydrated skin. Dehydration in skin causes dullness, accelerates fine lines and wrinkles, worst of all it increases oil production. These are my opinions and observations of 40+ years of personal skin care and skin care of others searching for the best way to take care of the largest organ of your body.

Any other SPF product has left my skin greasy after a few hours but this stays matte all day for me. It feels a little greasy when it goes on but soaks right in so quickly. And another little whine is that the tint does transfer to anything (towels, my counter, etc) before it dries so be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after using. And make sure to give the container a good shake before applying otherwise it can separate. Otherwise I can confirm: dries matte, stays matte, doesn’t break me out, feels breathable, has a blurring effect and protects my skin. Love.

Last month, I decided I wanted to try products from The Ordinary, to see how well they did for my skin. I was suffering with skin so dry that it was peeling & getting scaly, was itchy, & was a bit painful. I have always been dry, but this was extreme & came on suddenly. I had just run out of a 4 of my staple skincare items, so I ordered new products, including this oil. I was AMAZED br this oil. For under $10.00, it was working just as well as a $50.00 oil. I use this morning & night with my skincare routine. My skin is so moisturized &feels amazing. I highly recommend you try this if you have been eyeballing it. it's amazing.

Who would have thought that a simple and cheap serum would take the gold home?!? I love how just 2 drops is enough to smooth over all your face and your neck. I even smooth it all over my lips. It does feel a bit thicker than the other serums but not in a way that it feels gross or makes your skin super oily. It's like a thicker and baby soft feeling. Supple is a good way to describe it. I use this serum day and night after my Caudalie toner (first time trying it and still deciding if I should go back to the Estee Lauder one) and my Kate Sommerville Retinol mousse (only use this one at night). My face cream of choice also depends on the time of day: if it's daytime then I'll use Fresh's rose cream and if it's night I'll use something thicker like Skoah's dream cream. If my forehead is breaking out I'll use a face cream with salicylic acid just on that area. You guys have to give this one a try!

A lot of conditioners left me too heavy, or greasy, without really managing my frizziness or dryness. With three drops out of this bottle, my hair has been a different creature. It’s an incredible product. I use it in the shower after washing my hair. I’ll do a few drops, warm them up in my hands by rubbing my palms together, and then I’ll squeeze it gently into my hair, ends to crown, stopping a little above my ears. Then I’ll comb my hair into something one might consider orderly. No rinse required. I give this as gifts to my staff, my mom, my family. I get a ton of compliments on my hair, yet I do not treat it with anything, no styling, no colouring, nada. Only head and shoulders and this oil. I’m almost done with my first bottle after almost 6 months, and I can’t wait to repurchase. Pros: affordable, effective, simple. It has given me easy shine, curl definition, and healthy hair. Cons: Argan oil does smell a bit like trash (no, really), but I only notice the smell when I am trying to use a lot of oil on my body in the hot shower. The smell absolutely does not linger. Little bit of a learning curve; it’s easier to apply too little and add than it is to apply too much and remove. Three drops!

But as I said we are redheads meaning we have very fair skin and they stopped making our shade, Fair. There was only 4 shades to begin with. Now only 2. And it’s definitely too dark for me. And probably very orange. I’m very disappointed that I have to try to find something as close to this as possible. Not happy. And the packaging was a bit silly. A bottle with a pump.

I've been having trouble finding the perfect sunscreen. Some physical SPFs are too drying, and others are loaded with moisturizers that are too heavy for my combo skin. Chemical sunscreens redden my face after awhile. This product met my need perfectly. Those of us who are ""fair"" need sunscreen, too! I also love the way this product offers light coverage that smooths my pores. If I wait 5 minutes after applying, I find that I don't even need foundation, and my skin looks great. My bottle is nearly out, and I'm SO SAD that I cannot find the Fair shade, and the Tan shade seems to be missing, too.

In winter I use it together with rose deep hydration toner and kombucha essence, which helps my skin to stay moisturised without extra shine on my T zone. In summer I use it together with Origins mushroom toner and this combination works fine for me as well. It does bring certain glow to my skin, but I have never used it alone, thus I cannot say for sure that it works just fine on its own. I would say it's worth my penny :)

IT WORKS. I wear very little makeup to work and this has my oil under control for most off my eight hour work day. At the end of the day, I have a light dew. I am only giving it four star because my face broke out and I feel like it’s clogging my pores as the break out is more black heads than whiteheads. I came to this conclusion because I have been on the Curology regimen for some time now and my face cleared up beautifully. And once I started with the MURAD Oil and Pore Control Mattifier Broad Spectrum SPF 45, I have what I would consider a bad break out but I thought, maybe my skin is just adjusting to this new product. As I continued to use it, the breakouts reduced significantly but then I started to notice the black head. I think I must note that I continued my Curology regimen along with the MURAD Oil and Pore Control Mattifier Broad Spectrum SPF 45, so maybe the two are not compatible.

However, after trying this as well as the other new setting spray by Smashbox - I have yet to purchase any other setting sprays! This product is worth trying because, in my opinion, seems to actually DO what it claims and serves many more important purposes beyond just feeling refreshing and smelling nice. This Primer Water I only used as a setting spray, so I can’t speak on how well it works as a primer used beneath foundation. I feel this “Primer Water” version is incredible specifically for locking in makeup, making it truly last all day while looking naturally radiant, dewy & freshly done. If you’re like me and need something SERIOUSLY “transfer-proof”, you may enjoy the Smashbox Photo Finish Setting Spray more. Especially for those who work physically intensive jobs and need their makeup to LAST throughout sometimes sweaty work shifts. That one is truly as transfer-proof as any form of makeup I’ve tried thus far. Especially considering I’m one to blend my foundation, powder, etc. into my neck — but unfortunately must wear black collared shirts for my job. Before trying the Smashbox Setting Spray, the inside of my shirt collar would be nearly white as snow (compared to the black shirt) within just minutes of putting it on. Although a few $ more than some other brands and smells, feels and appears to be nothing more than water — its MAGIC, I promise!

I’d be buying this product in my 20s; in my 30’s I’ve learned what works, what doesn’t, and what products/practices are unnecessary- this is one of them. This offers a quick, but fleeting squirt of moisture. That’s it! An hour later, your skin is the same as if you hv have skipped this product all together. Re/ moisture and supple skin, Invest in good skin care, not quick-fixes. As for primers, I like something that glides over pores to minimize their appearance. This does not do that. Also has no bearing on the longevity of my foundation (my Armani Luminous Silk does better without this step).

When you open it you might be surprised about the amount of product inside for the large packaging, but the product matches the amount listed and the container is oversized. Second, it tends to be heavier than other water creams/gels. This is not a large con because it’s great for deep hydration and doesn’t get too greasy at the end of the day, but just makes it more of an overnight moisturizer than one for under makeup. For a high level summary, I have very dry and sensitive skin. This smells nice and the fragrance does not irritate me, but it can be a little heavy if you want to layer it with other products as I do. Great for redness and deep hydration if that’s what you are looking for.

I messed up my mantle with actives as the weather changed from warm to cold. So, everything I put on my face (even the normal stuff) felt like sunburn. I reduced my routine to moisturizer only. After days of this reduced routine, I went to Sephora to look for a fix. I tried a popular ceramide lotion and it felt like fire. We wiped it off with micellar water. Still on fire. THEN we put this on my face and I was immediately relieved. Every day since then has been more hydrated than the last. The cystic acne that was developing in response to my broken barrier is now gone. Bonus, my wrinkles look reduced and my skin has a nice healthy glow. No oil slick.

It didn't make me break out, which was a plus, but I also didn't find that it really helped with oiliness like I thought it would. I may have to give it another go.

My skin is acne prone and sensitive so you can imagine how scared I was to try a new product. It can be slightly greasy once putting on but over weeks I've noticed my acne scarring to lighten up and my skin texture smoothed. My only negatives would be the slight greasy feeling of the moisturizer and the several sporadic breakouts I've experienced since using this product. Other than that it pretty much lives by what it claims to do.

Skin Type Dry",4 stars,"I really like this product for my oily and very acne prone skin. It's definitely super lightweight and absorbs fast, which is always great. I think it works well under makeup, but I can also see how some people would want more moisture for underneath makeup too. I don't love the smell because it has a slightly chemical scent, but I don't hate it either and I'd rather that than artificial fragrance which irritates my skin. It truly is a super lightweight and non-greasy moisturizer that provides a hint of moisture, without being heavy or sitting on top of the skin. It will definitely not clog your pores and it has retinol which is great for acne, texture, and wrinkles. I do not think this will necessarily fill in wrinkles because the percentage of retinol isn't listed, which makes me thing it's minimal, but it will help improve texture on the skin and will help to even out hyper pigmentation while providing a bit of moisture and without causing blemishes. It is definitely not for those with dry or super dehydrated skin, as it doesn't moisturize super well, but for me and my oily skin it's perfect. Of course you shouldn't use this in the morning without sunscreen because it does have the retinol, but I honestly love it both morning and night. I think it's an especially great nighttime moisturizer for acne prone skin since so many of us unfortunate cystic prone people cannot wear anything remotely heavy or overly moisturizing at night without causing problems. Great, solid product. Do I think it will revolutionize/cure all of your skin concerns? No. Do I think it's a great moisturizer for oily skin people? Yes, even if it's just used as a nighttime moisturizer in tandem with other stronger retinol products. Will this fill in all of your wrinkles? No, but it will prevent wrinkles and help even out skin tone and texture, without causing any breakouts. Is it super moisturizing? No, but just enough for my oily skin!

It's actually similar to honey itself but obviously a lot more creamy. It is so soft and creamy, the texture is my favorite thing. If you have dry skin this is a must have because it's like a cross between a oil and a lotion, it's like the best of both worlds. I actually have oily skin myself but I like to feed my skin hydration and moisture. This oil would definitely work well in colder climates or in the fall or winter. Its also great for nighttime use, but it also looks really pretty under my foundation. In the summer I see myself using this more at night but I would definitely continue with this all year round. This is definitely in my top three face oils. Its one of the most moisturizing and hydrating oils I've ever used.

This product also feels like an ultra rich oil but is actually “lightweight” because it feels heavy at first but start to apply it everywhere and you’ll notice how quickly it absorbs into your skin. It doesn’t feel heavy at all throughout the day even under make up. I would say if you are using more then two drops, you’re already putting too much on and that’s just wasting product. Especially for the winter season this product has been wonders keeping my skin healthy and glowing while staying hydrated. I’m very impressed with this product which is becoming my everyday go to moisturizer. Love seeing the difference in my skins texture, I never knew I could have such healthy looking skin! Of course, a good skincare routine helps as well ;) I will say, for anyone who needs the moisture but is hesitant to give it a go, start with one drop and apply sparingly to face to 2-3 a week.

I swear by this product- I use it (by patting it into my dry skin with clean hands) as my first step in my morning routine and after I use a sheet mask after I take a shower. Since I moved to the east coast I struggled with extreme dry skin (my skin would always flake and get eczema and my makeup would always look so caked and gross) but now I never get flakey dry skin even in the winter. It’s also so great for sensitive skin like mine that also suffers from eczema. I also like the watery consistency because it doesn’t clog pores. However because it is a liquid consistency and because I have such dry skin I pair it with a cream or face oil afterwards!

You'll see that the scissors are able to push down the inside base post completed use - where-as the Q-tip can't, being too weak.

I got this a year back due to my thin face and age, and * combined * it with my other anti-wrinkle serums that worked on me (REN Flash Hydro-Boost, DNA and Estee Lauder Night Repair Serum). Estee Lauder Night Repair Serum note: don't get the tester online because ppl mix it with alcohol then resale on amazon, the hidden alcohol causing your wrinkles to get worse so you'll come back and buy.. WORKS FOR ME My 44 year old face with this combo looks like a late 20's to mid-30s. I've gotten hit-on by early 20 yr old guys - so I know it's working!!!! A year ago I stopped this Wrinkle Warrior due to the expense of having to get all-of-the-above noted, along with LINGHZI face masks --- but I'm back because it really did make a final clearing of lines. When I stopped, the smileys came back when I smiled. And I want to smile. :D See what combo works best with your skin .. And hope this experience helps!

I've spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a moisturizer that not only absorbs well but actually works and this one is a winner so far. iT has a nice light clean smell and feels amazing on my skin. absorbs fairly quickly considering it's on the heavier side for moisturizers. I especially love putting it on after using a peel. I use toner and put a good layer of th is on before bed and wake up with silky smooth plump skin. loved it so much I ended up getting the associated eye cream as well which is also a winner. I know its pricey but one jar had lasted me almost 3 months and theres still a good amount left. I'd say its even better than Dermalogica Super Rich. If you suffer from excessively dry flaky skin give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it.

It is a nice spf but feels more like one than a moisturizer. It’s a white thick cream that left me shiny until I matted with powder. As much as I like the glow, I was looking for an spf I can wear in place of my makeup powdered spf. This unfortunately still needs powder on top as it doesn’t really absorb, I stayed pretty shiny. Wanted to love it and may try the other versions of this in the winter. There seems to be a couple different spf levels, and age targeting vs brightening.

I decided to buy this even knowing with every fiber in my body that any antioxidants in jar packaging will be destroyed once its exposed to air and light (hence you should always buy creams/lotions/serums in opaque tube or pump packaging). anyways, after 5 months of use i really haven't noticed a difference in my skin. my fine lines on my forehead and under eyes are still there. I have south asian, dry skin and it really didn't hydrate it much either. In fact, in the evening my face always seemed sorta of drier after using this-- i would have to top it up with another moisturizer (from paulas choice). Anyways, i say pass on this. the ingredient list is wicked but its way too expensive for essentially doing nothing. Must have been the jar packaging!!!! ugh

The texture in the bottle is okay, but on the face it's weird, it didn't spread easily and I didn't feel it was hydrating enough for me. However, it didn't seem to have broke my skin either. The WORST for me, was the peeling effect when putting makeup after (like beauty sponge). Horrible, it flaked on my cheeks and chin. Will never buy again, but I like the other product for the contour of my eyes I bought with it (I'm not hating the brand, only the product).

Skin Type Combination",3 stars,"Pros: I have very dry and flaky skin around my nose/chin area to the point I can't wear foundation too long before it starts to separate and flake off around my nose/chin area. I have tried many different night moisturizers/masks with no luck. When I saw this product on Sephora with all the great reviews, I decided to give it a try and I'm happy I did. I can now wear foundation throughout the day and feel confident it will actually last. Cons: Now the ONLY con and reason I will probably never purchase again, is because they don't make it available to purchase separately. When the product arrived, I received so much more of the water cream mask than the cooling gel. I tried so hard to be frugal with the gel and generous with the mask, but I still ended up with so much cream mask left over. For the price, I don't think I can keep buying every couple of weeks just for the gel and wasting all the left over cream product. BTW: I noticed some people saying it doesn't give them the hydration needed. Since my face is extremely dry/flaky/sensitive, I apply a layer of 'Aquaphor: Advanced Therapy' before before this 2 step mask and every night time routine I've had the last year. It has helped my skin resist drying from a fan or a/c blowing at night, and helps me absorb this product slower throughout the night(my skin will literally inhale any product up within a couple hours). Hope this helps.

I tried this on a gut feeling after a different brand cleansing remover didn't work out as I'd hoped. The true test would be if it would be effective on my waterproof mascara. I often use the pads of my fingers to apply cleansing oil, and all my eye makeup – primer, shadow, waterproof gel eyeliner, and most of my waterproof mascara, went off within the first swipe! Passing the pads of my fingers over my lashline twice over, after that, and the rest of the mascara was gone! It was so quick and effective, the rest could be used to cleanse the rest of my face. So, it turns out I don't need much per makeup removal, very economical. Wash off with water, clean as a whistle! I double cleanse, but I could've been good as is. Second thing I was concerned about was breaking out afterwards, since my skin is HIGHLY sensitive and prone to breaking out. ZERO breakouts. I found my Holy Grail cleansing oil!

So far I love every Biossance product I’ve tried so when I ran out of my midnight recovery cleansing oil (which I love) I thought I would love Biossance’s just as much. It is more product for less money which is a plus, and neither stung my eyes. Biossance’s doesn’t have an overly strong smell but I prefer Kiehls. What sucked for me is it gave me large pimples specifically white heads on my chin, lip area, and forehead. Everyday I used it I would gain another pimple. As soon as I stopped using it they all went away. I tried going back to it and same thing happened. I’m super bummed and ended up returning it. I don’t know what ingredient did it to me since both have Squalene but like other reviews have said it did leave my skin feeling really dry. Too bad :(

My skin looks much more moisturized, soft, and this has really helped with the dry skin and breakouts (possibly exacerbated by dry skin) that I’ve been struggling with this winter. Now that I’m using this, I can use my retinol every other night, alternating with glycolic acid, without dryness or irritation. My t-zone does get a little shiny after 8 hours, but nothing a little powder doesn’t fix. If your skin is oily, this is probably not for you. I wouldn’t use it during the humid summer. But for my dry skin in winter and cooler months, this is perfect.

I bought it because Beautypedia gave it five stars and I tend to find their reviews trustworthy, especially since there aren’t many products that earn a five-star rating. I got this as a cheaper replacement for the Drunk Elephant Protini, and I like that the packaging is very similar. The airless pump protects the ingredients from breaking down after being exposed to oxygen, and from becoming a breeding ground for bacteria after dipping your fingers in it repeatedly. It has a rich, creamy consistency that makes it perfect as a night cream. As another reviewer said, it’s great for locking in your serums all night. I don’t use it as a day cream since the texture is so rich and it doesn’t have any SPF. It sinks in during the night and my skin always feels very soft when I wake up in the morning.

I adore DE’s LaLa Retro Whipped Moisturizer and pretty much use every night mixed with a few drops of Marula oil. The Baba Bomb is the equivalent, BUT it’s so perfect for daytime rather than night. It looks gorgeous under makeup, and really helps keep my skin moisturized and adds a nice glow. Baba is not too thick, not too oily, but moisturizes so well. This is the perfect concoction of ingredients! I much prefer the Baba Bomb over DE’s Protini, which tends to leave my skin dry wanting more moisture. So impressed with Tarte’s skincare. Love the packaging and airtight pump too. Their Vitamin C Serum is also amazing! 42 with combination to dry skin.

Beautiful ingredients and a really great price for a nice nighttime cream to lock in all my serums. I love the delivery system with the pump jar.

It leaves my skin hydrated, plump and soft. Absolutely no greasy residue and works great for the dry patches I get sometimes on my cheeks. If you like water creams but want more moisture/hydration without losing that quick absorption, definitely give this a try. It can be used day or night (especially if you have oily skin) but I’m personally using this in the AM only right now.

I am a fair-skinned blonde that has always had pinker cheeks and chin. I do not necessarily need heavy face makeup as I am in my early 30's and have fairly good skin. The first day I used this, my husband (who never comments on anything) immediately said how ""radiant"" I looked. It went on so smooth and hid all my redness. It lasted all day, and gave the perfect amount of coverage. My concealer stick layers nicely on top on the days I have a raging zit. The color lasts all day and doesn't separate on my skin. I love that the color adjusts nicely to my natural tone. The best part about this is that it is actually good for your skin. I've always hated BB and CC creams, so the fact that I cannot live without this now is beyond me. I am not sure this would work for ladies with olive skin or darker skin. But I can confirm it even looked good on me when I had a base tan. My opinion is that this is best suited for fair to medium skin tones. Do yourself a favor. BUY THIS NOW if you have ever suffered from rosey cheeks or any redness anywhere. You will not be sorry! P.S.- I also love that this feels like you are wearing nothing on your skin! It also lays nicely over the plethora of skin care I use in the morning. Don't be scared by the green color....it blends nicely with a beauty blender or even a brush (I've used both and even used my hands one day at the gym!)

It instantly neutralizes redness, with good enough coverage that usually I just skip another layer of foundation or concealer - this is all I need for everyday wear. My one small complaint is that the perfumed scent is not super pleasant to me (i'm sure it's pleasant to others) - I usually avoid anything perfumed due to sensitivity, but the scent fades once it's on your skin, I don't notice it anymore after a minute or so. And I've never had any sort of negative reaction or skin flare-up from this, so it must just be a natural/gentle scent of some kind. Don't let that deter you, just letting other sensitive skin folks know, since that may turn you off initially. This stuff is amazing though, get it now.

I used to struggle with blotchiness and red spots, and dry skin that broke out easily if I used a super heavy moisturizer. My face used to jump between being super dry and super greasy, so this has calmed it down a ton. Everything is evened out and brighter, and if I go out without makeup nobody asks me if I’m sick lol. I typically wash my face and then put about two drops of this in with my summer moisturizer (a light gel) every morning. It definitely has an oily consistency, but it absorbs pretty easily and just keeps everything smooth throughout the day. I’ve found that for me it works best to limit it to about once a day. I also didn’t really like the smell at first and thought it was kind of fermented floral. It’s grown on me and now I feel like it’s a calming smell, like an essential oil or something.

I read that it also helped with acne scarring which was awesome because I struggle with that as well. So I bought it and OMG has it worked wonders. Not only has it helped tremendously with dryness but my dark spots from acne have been fading pretty significantly only after a month of using it. ALSO, my skin has stayed super clear! Clearer than it has been in a really long time. I've tried so many products to help with dryness and dark spots and NONE work like this one. I'm so happy with this oil, it's definitely worth $50.

I’m fairly dry and can tell if I don’t use this daily. It helps with texture, sometimes I use it in my hair. Love it under makeup. Can’t go without it. Only downside is they used to sell a small trial type size which is how I got hooked on it. Wish they still did so people could see the benefits plus it was perfect for travel.

My skin was cracking a few weeks ago and a Fresh representative working in Sephora recommended this to me since I’m am allergic to many synthetic fragrances and this has 100% natural fragrance. I’ve been patting three drops into my skin morning and night and I swear it has started fading my hyperpigmentation while fighting my breakouts, even when my hormonal acne tried to flare up. My skin still isn’t perfect, but it’s hydrated without being oily, my scars are fading, I’ve had less acne, and I have been comfortable without wearing foundation in public which is huge for me. It is pretty expensive but considering how little you should use a day and the size of the bottle, I would say it’s a good investment.

IMO any product with rose in it is hit or miss because it is one of those scents that can easily come off as overpowering. One of the possible culprits in this that makes it too strong smelling is the addition of chamomile flower extract ie. Anthemis nobilis. The advertised strengths of this toner would be its cooling sensation and gentleness which sounds appealing. However I couldn't bring myself to spray on my face. If you are leery of heavy scents, I strongly suggest sampling on a cotton ball or something other than your skin. I received this in Play!

I have owned the Tiger Grass Redness Correction cream forever. I love it. I think it does exactly what it claims to do. It is super hydrating, calming, and controls redness. My complaint about the cream is how thick it is. You can put the tiniest bit on and it still feels heavy. I really could only use it at night. Another complaint was the tube. The paint would chip all over your hands and it was a mess. When I saw the gel I was hoping it was lighter and more absorbant, but had the same affects as the cream. I was worried this wouldn't be as hydrating, but I decided to go for it anyways. This gel is awesome! It is suuuper light, super hydrating and moisturizing, and really controls the redness. It is the day version of the cream that I had been looking for. They also changed the tube, so the paint does not chip off. My one complaint is the cream lasted me FOREVER, months. I have had this gel for about a month and I'm ready for another. I don't believe the value is as good as the cream. But I will continue to use the gel in the AM and the cream at night. These products have been a god send to my skin!

This moisturizer might be holy grail for me because in using it pretty consistently for just a few weeks I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin. I have normal/oily skin but this doesn't dry it out at all, my skin absorbs it so well and this has reduced redness so much I have barely been using concealer. You can really use this morning or night. It's helped prevent acne too. The main reason I got this was because my skin started having allergic reactions to salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, leading me to believe my skin is on the sensitive side. I needed moisturizer to soothe the redness and irritation, a lot of which comes from winter time too. Long story short- amazing moisturizer especially if you have oily, acne prone, skin worth every penny

I got a sample of this with an order and was pretty happy with it. My skin was super soft, stayed clear, and looked slightly less red. Then, I went on vacation to New Hampshire. I spent four and a half hours hiking in 20 degree windy weather with snow and ice blowing in my face. My skin was bright red and stung from windburn. I put some of this on after I showered and then a little more before I went to bed. After the first time I put it on my face no longer stung and by morning, my skin wasn't red at all. Normally I would be red for a few days and then peeling afterwards. I am definitely going to purchase a full size of this and I think it will be really helpful for the New England winter and beyond.

It’s exactly what I’m looking for (a moisturizer with retinol to use at night so I don’t have to do two different steps), and it’s from a brand I’ve used before and really like. Then, I looked at the ingredients. Dimethicone is the SECOND ingredient on the list. Seriously. I try to avoid silicones in my skincare when I can because they can be pore-clogging, and there is some evidence to suggest silicones can be bad for the water supply, but I’m not necessarily a huge stickler about it. That being said, I would never use a moisturizer where a silicone is literally the second ingredient. Silicones are great in primers because they fill in your pores and help give your skin that silky smooth texture. Why in the world would I want to fill in my pores before bed? And so, my hunt for a nighttime moisturizer with retinol continues...

This cream is amazing! I have had no sensitivity to it from night one. No acne breakout and over the past several weeks of using this, my eye wrinkles have become less pronounced and my forehead wrinkles have become less noticeable. It leaves my skin hydrated and with a nice soft glow. I have combination skin and has not caused me to be oily. I am very impressed with this moisturizer and would recommend it! I searched for a good cream that had the right ingredients to help with aging skin and this one hit almost all the pertinent ones! Only taking 1 star off bc I wish it wasn’t as pricey but you get what you pay for an I realize that there are a lot more expensive creams out there then this one. So go ahead and try it!

I tried the Kopari on one leg and the grocery store (organic) on the other and the Kopari seemed to sink into the skin while still leaving a glossy protective film. The grocery store oil sat on top of my skin, was quite oily and didn’t seem to sink in and hydrate like the Kopari. I wish this wasn’t the case because I would prefer to pay 5 bucks instead of $37 but I have to be honest and fair in what my experience was. I’m buying the large size of the Kopari. I have desert dry skin that literally cracks in the winter and is very painful. Hope this is helpful. Oh yes, and no annoying fragrance just a delicate coconut smell from the ingredient.

The oil was solid when I opened it, which I prefer, but the lid arrived a bit loose and had leaked around the rim and made for a messy first use. I scrape the product out with the back of my nails (though a spatula would definitely work better) and the heat of my hands melts it in seconds. Works ok removing foundation and regular eye makeup, but I have to run my fingers under the faucet a couple rounds and gently rub my lids to get liquid eyeliner and mascara off completely. Since rinsing leaves a layer of gunk, I follow up with a foaming cleanser. I have dry skin so it doesn't make me break out nor does it feel pore clogging with double cleansing. Prob works better as a body moisturizer but for the price vs. size of a jar, I have other go-to brands. Similarly, there are much better clean makeup removers that Sephora carries. Might be nice to travel with if carrying on since it's multipurpose.

I definitely still recommend following a “system” for the best treatment against acne ie. Wash face with a mild cleanser, then a calming toner, this oil, and followed by a hydrating face lotion (having your face dry between steps is key). But wow! It has done an amazing job to remove all the hormonal acne in 2 days. I have extremely sensitive combination skin that was doing great until pregnancy hormones hit.

I used Josie Maran Argan Oil - the original one for years and changed it to the Trader Joe’s Argan Oil for a while and just had the itch to come back. I kept seeing CBD oil frequently and researched the benefits. When I saw Josie Maran offering their version, I was like- maybe this is a sign LOL. Anyways, after 3 months of consistently using this as my moisturizer - day and night - my hyperpigmentation, redness, and overall skin has calmed down so much. I’m in love with this product and it’s even given me the confident to go makeup free to work! Of course this + my diet + eating vitamins (Olly multi vitamin + flawless complexion + Trader Joe’s vitamin c’s) all contributed. This oil was a game-changer though. Also if it helps - my skincare routine is very minimal. I only cleanse with Neogen Green tea cleanser + this skin dope as my moisturizer, and sometimes Sunday Riley Vitamin C moisturizer during the nights, but rarely because I’m lazy (again) LOL. Anyways, totally recommend this. I’ve attached a picture from this morning - I unfortunately didn’t take a “before” picture but my redness has gone down significantly and overall I’m really pleased with the results.

It says ""glow"" on the box and it did give me a healthy glow; not tingly or heat-generating, but a slight glow-from-within, balanced skin, look. I put it on my face, arms, hands, elbows, and it lasted a long time. I work in an extremely dry environment for 12 hour shifts and it kills my skin, hair, and nails. I brought that product to work and felt comfortable in my own skin for the first time in 3 1/2 years. So, I ran out and my local store is always out of everything. I searched for it on Sephora.com but the CBD oil version was the only one I could find. So, I tried it and I am more than disappointed. It sits on my skin and does nothing but make it look greasy. Then, it evaporates into the air in about 10-15 minutes. It doesn't absorb into my skin no matter how much I use and when it evaporates into the air, it leaves me feeling dryer than before I put anything on. I gave it a good try and I got better results from Wesson cooking oil. When I left work after my shift today, I threw it in the garbage, I was SO annoyed from re-applying and re-applying. And wasting money. The Skin Dope Hemp oil is so fantastic, I don't understand why J. M. wasted time developing the CBD one. It creates product confusion and the truth is, the CBD oil version is just plain inferior to the hemp oil version. I am kind of disgusted with trying products at Sephora, coming back to repurchase like the loyal customer I am, and finding it's no longer available, sold out, or I buy a similar looking/sounding product by mistake and find out I bought a ""lemon"". I don't have the time or money for this hassle. And now I certainly do not have enough hydrated, happy skin to last until I can get to the store or order delivery, and hope I get the right product.

The individual said it works on oily skin and I do not need a primer as this moisturizer acts like a primer if i ever do put foundation on. After trying it without priming my oily face for a good week.....it did not do me any justice. So far a three star for me because it does keep my oily face at bay when i apply primer with it. It feels nice on my skin and keep my acne at bay.

I change pillowcases often, a small price to pay for nice skin I suppose. The smell is floral, and it does linger long enough. I wash the residue off of my face in the morning with an oil based cleanser and my skin glows. I have stopped having to wear foundation because of this cream. I only spot conceal, powder, do my brows and eyes, and I’m out the door. I use the Tatcha Dewy Skin cream after cleansing in the morning with no issues. They make a good team.

My t-zone can get oily but my cheeks and jawline are sooo dry so it’s not easy finding something that doesn’t make my problems worse. In one day I noticed a difference and in two days my family was mentioning that my skin was looking glowy and clearing up. In 5 days most of my blemishes were gone and finally my foundation starting looking like I’ve always wanted and I even felt confident enough to go without it recently. Normally I react to fragrance but for whatever reason I didn’t to this. One thing I did notice is that when I applied my Volition Strawberry C Serum before the moisturizer, it pilled up and balled up. I started only using the moisturizer after cleansing then applying foundation on the days I want to wear makeup and saving my serums for night time only, that has seemed to work great so far!

I found a sample so I could try it out first. Because there's tamanu oil, I thought that the scent would be nutty. I hate the scent of tamanu oil. It also mentions sunflower oil and ginger so I was like, is it spicy it something? However, the Daily Reviving Concentrate is pleasantly citrus scented. I'd say it's mostly lemon-y. No trace of peanut butter or related foods. The oil has a similar effect as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate. I expect you could probably use either one at any time during the day (don't quote me on that). There are some oils in both that I've read can create damage when exposed to sun, so if it's concerning to you I'd recommend looking that up. This oil mentions that it prevents damage from the sun so maybe it cancels itself out. I don't know. I also need to educate myself on which order to use this with sunscreen. All that said, I love this almost as much as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate, which is to say A LOT. MRC is in my top 5 beauty products. Excited to be able to add a new one to the family!

I cant believe how many brands are out there now that “feel” like this at first but dont even come close in performance. Dont be duped. Your money is well spent here and the jar lasts quite a while!

She said that when clients come in looking for something similar to La Mer without such a high price point, she always recommends the AMOREPACIFIC brand. I am so glad I listened to her because she was spot on. This moisturizer is light but hydrating. It smells lovely but it’s not over powering. I have oily skin and I felt like the La Mer sometimes would just sit on my skin. This stuff absorbs so well and once it sets in it doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy. So, I love the product and it’s also way less expensive than what I was using before. Win, win! I would definitely recommend.

A little bit goes a long way (as others have mentioned) so much so, that if you use too much product it will not easily absorb into the skin and is why I think a few people had issues with it leaving the skin “tacky”. I’ve never felt that way with this product, however. A pea sized amount (or less) will cover the entire face. Thank goodness, because that really helps it to last longer. I have generally dry skin, but get slightly oily on my nose and on my lower brow near the bridge of my nose. This helps my skin stay hydrated and soft all day and is perfect under my makeup.

I have sensitive, combination skin that gets oily in my t-zone and dry around the edges of my face. A Sephora employee recommended I try the Amorepacific moisture bound hydra-gel, and it has changed my skin! I no longer get dry anywhere, and it has helped reduce the oil in my t-zone. My skin tone is more even, and my skin looks brighter. I use this moisturizer day and night and it lasts me about two months. I absolutely LOVE this product and am so, so glad I found it!! I also went through cleansers with each of the above brands, and the Amorepacific Treatment Cleansing Foam is a DREAM, and I'll leave a separate review for that.

The fragrance is soft and fresh when you first apply it but it goes away within minutes of application.

Well it does have a smell it smells like oil. It dissipates after it's completely soaked into your hair. It worked for about 2 weeks and then I used it after that and I was noticing it did not work no more so I don't know whether it lost its potency but it doesn't work for me anymore. So I returned it.

Iv been using it since September, once a day, on my over plucked eyebrows where I havent had hair grow in a long time, NOW GROWING! Its amazing! my eyebrows are starting to shape into what Iv always wanted and its all thanks to this product!! I would go months, MONTHS without doing anything to my brows and the hair just wouldnt grow no matter what, but since Iv been using this, its working so well!! I also love it cause if I have some extra on my eyebrows, I put the left over product on my nails or around my hair line, my nails are getting stronger and my hair line looks even better than before! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH! <3 This is just my experience with this and how it works for me, I hope it also works for you! (sorry ladies

IT WORKS! In less than 3 months of using this several nights a week the thinning areas around my part and hair line are filling in and evening out. I’ve had 3 babies in less than 4 years and I can’t tell you the last time my hairline looked like this. I don’t get around to styling my hair as often as I would like to but I have also found that those areas around my face and hairline that are more prone to damage and breakage look smoother and softer with the use of this product as well. I’m so happy I gave this a try!

You could have given my car an oil change with my face-grease when I was in middle school, so I know greasy. There’s a difference between greasy and hydrated. I am now in my late twenties and can feel that this cream is rich and hydrating, not greasy. I only use just a bit and really I only use it couple of nights a week. The smell is also divine, bright and orange-y. Try out just a little bit and see for yourself.

My skin still feels good at the end of the day and when I wake up. The first time I used it, I used a lot and it looked greasy and like it was sitting in my skin. It did absorb over time. The next time I used less and the results were much better. Less is definitely more with this product, which is great since it’s an AM/PM product. I’ve been using it for a week now and I’ve had no breakouts and my skin texture has become smoother and my glow has returned. I haven’t used it long enough to see if it reduces brown spots, but it has given my skin more brightness.

It felt stingy on first application but I assumed it was from the vit c or fragrances.

It would have to be heavy duty and it's not, which I didn't expect it to be. I use a little for the Vitamin C and then apply my regular moisturizer (Bioelements Rich Moisture) over it. It's really nice and they both hold together all through the day. It's worked really well for lightening my freckle spots, which show easily on fair skin in the winter. If you have really dry skin like me then this will be another step or your Vitamin C step, not full moisturizer.

I didn’t notice the new change in the description on the label immediately, but kept wondering what was wrong with the product as it was not moisturizing as it had been in the past. Then I saw an old order of mine and noticed the product number was different. It was a highly rated product, so I don’t understand the change. “If it ain’t broke...”. So disappointed, and I will be looking for something else.

It sounded incredible that one product is capable of so much and given that the studies proved the effectiveness of the product, I was super excited to try it and now I can confirm myself that the product is amazing! I also really value how much care Caudalie puts in selecting ingredients for the products and that Caudalie products are not tested on animals and do not contain animal ingredients.

However, since my skin is on the dryer side I wished that the hydrated, dewy feeling lasted longer. I found myself needing to reapply it a few times during the day. Instead when I used the Caudalie divine oil, it left my skin smiling and soft all day. I am in love! As the name suggests its truly divine. The cream alone might not be sufficient if you have dry skin like me but for those looking for a clean, light moisturizer, this is the one.

It’s a very simple formation — only a few clean ingredients — which my hyper-sensitive, acne-prone skin really appreciates. The main star of this product is fermented green tea. It nourishes, hydrates and heals the skin extremely well. If you find yourself in the midst of an over-exfoliation crisis (been there) or a bad breakout (me, every month from being an idiot who tries too many products), you need this! I highly suggest keeping your routine simple and just using a gentle cleanser, this essence and a dab of moisturizer. Then watch your skin thrive!! I also want to add that I have tried basically all of the holy grail essences: SK-II, Tatcha, Missha, Neogen, Primera, etc. Amore Pacific is the all-round winner for me!

I also have very sensitive skin, but this essence is so gentle I have never had a bad reaction. It feels calming and soothing. It’s crazy expensive, but it works.

Think, “Are you wearing makeup?” - someone asking you because your skin looks so good that you must be wearing makeup but one can’t really tell if you are. I splurged and bought the full sized product. A little goes a REALLY LONG WAY so this should last you close to or up to a year or so. I use it morning and night. I would add this at the very minimum to my skincare routine if nothing else. This is the first and one of the only products I have ever used that have wowed me to the point that I very highly recommend it to anyone.

However, it was disappointing. I used this on a few occasions with different application methods. I always start with small amounts at first, as most kbeauty brands have a “less is more” application method... wasn’t impressed. I tried adding bigger dollops on my face, no larger than a dime... I felt even stickier than before. Then I tried my quartz roller, with about the same amount as last time. After that, I tried applying with my finger tips again but patted it outwards on my face... No matter what I tried, it always made my face feel sticky, and that it just sat on top of my skin. I didn’t even feel that my face was moisturized. It gave the appearance of dewy, moisturized skin... but my face actually felt dryer after each use, and my skin texture went down hill. I will say, that it did not clog my pores though. Overall, I would highly recommend a sample before trying it for yourself. I won’t be recommending it to anyone, and you’re better off with another K Beauty brand.

It is super lightweight so this will not cover the redness of a pimple, but I use in just under my eyes and it's perfect. If you prefer the natural look, you will not be disappointed. I gave it 4 stars because it does tend to crease a bit as it is like a concealer consistencey and I have to mix two shades to get my perfect color right now, wish they had more than three shades.

I have tried, sampled and bought probably 30 products to camouflage my dark undereye circles, and I almost despaired of finding anything that would work for me. Then I saw a review of this on Youtube and decided to try yet another one. This one is different! The color on my computer is misleading - I got Light-Medium and it is a very forgiving formula, that has a flesh tone that will likely work with many skin tones. There's also a darker version. With this I don't need to apply concealer on top. It's just different from any other corrector or concealer. If you are frustrated trying to find something that works, give this a shot. Wonderful Sephora, you can return it if it doesn't work for you.

This product gives me just about the same glow that I got from La Mer for a way better price. It’s still expensive (that’s why I took off a star) but it hydrates my skin and it hasn’t broken me out. The consistency made me uneasy at first, it looks like a gel + pomade mixture but it’s easy to apply and melts into your skin. It doesn’t feel greasy or tacky like I expected and you don’t need a lot of product. If you’re still uneasy just get a sample, it’s worth trying. For reference, my skin is normal but feels tight if I don’t moisturize after cleansing. I also learned I have sensitive skin (I got weird bumps on my face after trying another product most reviewers had no issues with). Hope this helps!

My skin drinks it up, it really feels like my skin is being quenched when I'm applying it and I wake up with the softest, smoothest skin that feels so nicely moisturized. I've been using this for over a year now and the only thing I would change is the packaging. I wish it didn't come in a jar but rather an airtight bottle to keep the ingredients from breaking down over time. But it seems like most night time moisturizers come in jars for some reason.

Reaching my late thirties I wanted to start a skin care regimen. This was a sample. Caused me to break out after only three nights. I had no problem with my skin, turns out now I do. It's probably the diamethicone in it. Maybe it works wonders but I won't know because I won't be trying it anymore. If you have combination oily or acne prone skin, do try a sample first because it is comedogenic. I can't give it any higher rating because I have not seen it's miracle, it's in a jar and also has fragrance plus it's expensive. Though I tried to find some aspect to give it two stars, I honestly couldn't.

When I wake up I wipe over my face with a toner and this leaves my skin with enough hydration that it feels like it doesn't need to produce oils and actually helps combat my oily skin for several hours. It seems counter productive to use a heavy moisturizer with oily skin but I've been using this and some other super moisturizing masks overnight and it honestly does help to keep moisture way down in the skin so the skin doesn't feel like in needs to be oily to fix the dryness it thinks it has. Just wipe off the top layer of product that's on top of the skin with a gentle toner and you're ready to go. I am giving this product four stars instead of five purely for the ridiculous price tag. Yes the product does work well but you are paying for the brand name.

Most importantly this does not hydrate my dry skin and it is not cosmetically elegant. Applying foundation over this moisturizer leads to a patchy application that clings to the moisturizer and cakes up.

And I belive the cream made me break out the first two weeks. The breakout subsided, but it's worth to keep it mind if you easily break out. So even if my skin is dry, this product is perhaps a bit to heavy. But probably amazying for really dry skin.

I'd say it's important to sit awake with the mask on for at least 15 minutes, as other reviewers have said, to give the mask a chance to soak in. It helps it not be as sticky on your pillow and such. That being said, it is a smidge sticky if you put anything other than a ~thin~ layer on. I wasn't bothered by it though, especially compared to other night masks I've tried.

Lady at the location in Fremont, CA (Pacific Commons), recommended me several but she spoke most highly about this one from caudalie. I don't know the impacts of its long term use but I do notice that after incorporating it into my skincare routine, it has most definitely helped with the absorption of other products afterwards (serum, moisturizer, etc.). It also doesn't feel tacky, which was something I was looking out for since I tried the fresh kombucha essence and it left my skin tacky. I have combination skin and this didn't make me more oily/dry or irritate my skin. Great price for an essence! :)

So I purchased this without having it tested on my skin , just because od lots of good reviews that I've read about it. And all I can say is I'm so impressed with how it made my skin look and feel the morning after! I was so shocked that upon initial application or using this, I got an instant result! It refined my skin/ pores in the mildest way possible, made my skin extra smooth and soft, and really brighten my skin. My face was glowing that morning! Smell is not overwhelming, just mild and will also disappear in a few seconds. I've tried other korean essences ( like MTR) but this gave me the fastest results ( overnight) and multiple benefits in 1 night! I am not joking. It made my face velvety smooth and soft, satisfied me and gave me the benefits I wanted with my skin! I know it's kinda expensive but it's so worth it and will also last you long! Maybe this will last me 1 year.. lol

My foundation that I have been using for 10 years and had always loved had started looking so bad. So I tried other foundations, moisturizers, and primers etc. Nothing helped. It all looked bad. So I went back to the foundation I have loved for many years and had given up hope that it would ever look as good as it use to on my skin. A few days later I decided to use some of this night cream I had from a free gift under my foundation. OMG! The lifting and forming is incredible and lines under my eyes greatly diminished.The foundation does not settle into the lines AT ALL with this night cream underneath and I have a glow that was not there before. Also it is very hydrating but not greasy. I use Estée Lauder ecru double wear foundation and now I’m in love with my foundation again thanks to this night cream I’m using as a day cream. Getting older is not fun, but this product makes it much better! Thank you Lancôme!

I’m in my 30s and have weird skin that breaks out from a lot of products, I also get some redness from the retinol and acids that I use for acne and anti aging. Most moisturizers do one of the following : break me out, make me look like a grease ball, do nothing, burn/tingle, or dry me out. I got this as a gift and I have to say this is one of the top ten gifts I’ve ever received. My skin feels incredible, and all my redness goes away even if I just used an intensive peel. It never stings even on chapped skin, and it makes me glow but not shine. I have never had an HG product before, and as a Rouge skincare junkie that’s saying a lot. Please always carry this. The only change I’d like is a pump bottle, but honestly because this is so good I don’t care.

I was nearly out of the balm and gave this a go. It is great, lightweight and fragence free. It takes a little more time to remove my mascara than the balm, but it is still hands down a great item, Will repurchase and recommend.

The consistency of it is very thin (as opposed to my other fave, Boscia's Make-up Breakup, which is a little thicker), but two pumps of this works very well to get makeup and sunscreen off at the end of the day. I'd give it five stars except when I received the latest bottle, about a tenth of the product had leaked during transit and soaked through the packing paper and even half of the shipping box—in spite of the pump being in the locked position. Be careful if you plan on traveling with it.

I’ve struggled to find the perfect moisturizer for YEARS and once day I went to sephora and voiced my areas of concern and the lady pointed me to this moisturizer, at first I got a sample because I honestly didn’t even believe her.. I had tried FAB products before and hated them so I was hesitant with this one .. I have normal to combination skin that breaks out occasionally and I find I have larger pores around my nose .. my break out areas however are on my cheeks for some reason and sometimes forehead but anyways, in my struggle to find the perfect moisturizer that keeps me hydrated all day, isn’t thick, and has brightening properties for my scars, mostly ALL of them made my t-zone oily which shouldn’t be the case to my normal to comb skin. When I tell you I’ve tried everything for moisturizers, believe I have. From tatcha, to claudalie, etc. Most moisturizers left me oily, mattefying ones made me feel dry, water creams made me feel not moisturizer and oily, other FAB ones broke me out.. THIS moisturizer is everything I asked for, hydrating but my t-zone does not get oily throughout the day and I don’t have to wipe my forehead anymore, and the rest of my face feels hydrated all day. I gave it four stars because I have been trying different skin routines and I am not sure which of the products I’m using is really working since 4 are new to my routine (been trying to find the perfect one) but anyways, I went back and bought the full size and perhaps I’ll update you in a couple of weeks.

I struggle with finding any skincare products that actually work for me and provide the nutrients and anti aging qualities I want. I usually buy the water cream from tatcha because it actually doesnt break me out and the other reviews were so good. it costs a pretty penny though, and also contains alcohol and gold (which is unnecessary, I dont know how I feel about putting it on my face either) so I took a LOT of time to find a similar, GOOD replacement that is still a water like cream. I used skin charisma to look up the ingredients and effects by skin type, and this seemed to be the best candidate in comparison to the water cream, glacier skin cream by saturday skin (prolly my second choice to this), dewy skin cream (fungal acne trigger), protini, clinique surge, and caudalie sorbet. I chose this because the ingredients are clean, alcohol free, and include many benefits like anti aging, antioxidants, oil inhibitor, and acne fighting. the consistency is similar to the water cream, but a little more rich in texture. a little goes a long way. I love that it is in a tube as well so that the ingredients stay potent for longer. I've used it for a few weeks now and so far no bad skin reactions, a significant minimization of pores and oiliness, and soft, hydrated skin. it may feel like it applies a little gel like at first similar to the glacier cream but it absorbs quickly like the water cream, which I love!

Skin Type Combination",4 stars,"This is a good product I believe. I have dry skin on my chins meanwhile I suffer from clogged pores, blackheads and acnes. I must use oil-free stuff otherwise my pores will be clogged badly but I need a strong moisturizer. This product satisfies my needs. To those who have oily skins I must say this product cannot prevent you from oiling. It just a moisturizer and it’s oil-free. I believe it contains some kind of ingredients like vaseline to seal your skin and prevent moisture running away from your skin. So for oily skin the condition maybe worse if you use it. I have a tip for people who have oily skins, try to apply a thin layer of pure vitamin c powder after all the stuff you used. Hope this helps.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"This oil-free mattifying gel's name suggests an underwhelming, only-for-oily-skin-wearing benefit, if not simply a summer weight moisturizer. While it is that, this does not make your face look or feel particularly mattified, but it shines in the multiple antioxidant and skin beneficial ingredients it boasts. It's an anti-aging powerhouse in a lightweight, easily absorbed formula! The name really should be changed to indicate it's a lightweight moisturizing gel for all skin types. I agree with others that it makes a great primer base, does not make my face shiny like others do, and it's a one-step method to get the anti-aging, repairing ingredients that my finds useful. The packaging keeps these photo- and air-sensitive ingredients stable, so no worries about opening a jar and all benefits are gone! I love this underrated moisturizer, and feel completely comfortable using it as opposed to a multi-step concoction of ingredients when on the go. Best thing - it does not cause my sunscreen or makeup to pill!

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"This has been my daily wear for six months. I've tried a lot of BB and CC creams, as I prefer the natural coverage and added protection/benefits they provide over anything I've experienced with a foundation. This has a drier, more cream-to-powder texture than many BBs and CCs I've tried and used. I prefer it, although it took a little getting used to at first. I find it applies better with a brush (I use Sephora's #63) than with fingers, although fingers will do in a pinch. I'm quite pale and have very neutral undertones, so I struggle finding shades that work for me. Many are too yellow or too dark, even in the lightest available color, but this one is perfect and forgiving. You don't have to wear a full face of it to get natural, even coverage-- it color corrects to appear as though you're wearing nothing at all, but all of your redness is gone and your pores are invisible, so if you only need it across your nose and cheeks, only wear it there and it'll still look great and natural! I tend towards oiliness, although I've been more balanced the last year or so. I set with a generic setting powder and then spritz with a facial spray (NOT a setting spray), and the finish lasts a very long time-- all day if the day isn't too hot/sweaty/strenuous. I also tend to break out-- deep, painful cysts-- if my skin doesn't like a product for whatever reason. This does NOT contribute to that phenomenon, and I have no issues wearing it while broken out. This is a ride or die for me. I have and still occasionally use others, but this is my favorite.

However, it made me break out like crazy. I can’t think of why, because the ingredients are supposed to be wonderful for your skin. I do have sensitive, acne-prone skin, so do with that what you will. I had to, reluctantly, return this product. I would recommend this because it looked stunning, but if you can find a sample anywhere or are comfortable returning products that didn’t work for you, be aware of how it affects your skin.

But, what this stuff really does is fix your face with a beautiful glow. (with or without makeup) I have noticed a decline in my winter redness since reincorporating this into my skincare routine, and I look glowy and fresh throughout the day! Worth the money, I highly recommend. Also has a light fragrance that is non-irritating, and zero alcohol.

I have been using this for 3 days and I am amazed and in shock with how it performs! The best part is it is good for your skin! I spray this on even when I am not wearing makeup.

The mist contains: •Vitamin fruit complex: vitamins C, E, and B5; lemon and orange fruit extracts; and minerals to revitalize dull skin. •NO Alcohol. The mist comes in an aerosol style cannister, but it does not spray continuously - you just spritz where you want it to go. The scent is really fruity and sweet and it instantly refreshes my skin. I prefer to use this to help awaken my skin in the morning and as a pick-me-up in the afternoon or after working out. I need something a little stronger in a setting spray due to the heat and humidity where I live.

A week after using it at night and in the morning my skin is super soft and smooth all day, and I am just disappointed I didn't splurge for it earlier. I have had no new starts of pimples, so I don't think it will make me break out. I know a lot of people are recommending it as a night cream, but it also soaks in pretty quickly, so it layers well under makeup if you want to wear it in the morning.

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"My skin type: acne prone, normal to dry, uneven, dull. Effects of this spf: Adds a beautiful glow with slightly blurring effects and great hydration. Amazing whipped mouse like texture. Great for brightening, sun protection, and hydrating. In terms of getting rid of dark spots I havent used this long enough to know whether or not it will work but as someone who is obsessed with skincare and effective ingredients I can honestly say this is the best spf I have ever used and the ingredients are great for what it claims to do although works way better if paired with a vit.c serum in the morning... Truth be told after years of dealing with hyperpigmentation I truly only recommend retinol, AHA's, and vit.c serums. Nonetheless everyone and their mother should be using an spf and I find this is the only one that doesnt break me out, leave a white cast, or gets greasy throughout the day. Thus, if your skin is dull slightly on the dry side or normal and you wanna kick up your vit. c serum a notch I would definitely recommend this. If you hate shimmer like effects or radiant finishes this may not be your cup of tea and I would recommend an spf from either Farmacy or Supergoop for those looking for beneficial ingredients.

Initially the texture is similar to a balm and appears to be more on the firm side. I scoop onto my fingers then gently massage into my skin... This is when the magic happens! With the warmth of my skin the cream instantly just melts into my skin. It almost feels like water but a more buttery water like texture, so hydrating and moisturizing. It feels like a hybrid between a water cream and a body butter, yet not too thick but not too thin either. Water creams tend to leave my skin wanting more, and thick creams tend to be too heavy. The Vital-E cream is the best of both worlds and perfect for my 42 yo combination skin. Perfect for my nighttime routine to lock everything in for recovery sleep mode. This is one of the first Peter Thomas Roth products I’ve tried and I am impressed!!! Such a standout moisturizing cream for me.

This eye cream applies smooth and you do not need much at all. It does not migrate toward your eyes or lashes, and absorbs quickly. The texture is smooth and buttery. It is a product that starts as a solid, you warm it in-between your ring get tips and then it liquifies and “activates” all the much needed properties. That part is a little tricky, but there is a video online showing you how. The appearance of my under eye area and fine lines/crows feet is dramatically improved. Lines are almost invisible, and it softens and brightens the area. It’s very hydrating and has a luxurious feel to it. You do receive your money’s worth for this product, the vial is large and lasts a long time. I used it am and pm for my results. It isn’t harsh or burning to the sensitive eye area. You do have to leave it absorb and dry before applying any concealer. It blends well with the Vital-E moisturizer, so you should try them together! My skin is loving this!!! I will be purchasing this again.

What I do not like: The price tag is rather inflated. The gold flecks are for looks only, they are not small enough to be distributed onto the face for any kind of extra glow affect. And my biggest complaint, for a $95 product, i did not expect the lid to break/come apart 4 days into using the product, or at all for that matter. I keep my products stored in a temperature controlled environment and am nothing if not gentle with every product I have invested my hard earned money in. So I thought that was pretty pathetic for such a high end company and high price tag product. I had to put my oil in my own bottle to continue to using. All in all, the oil itself is indeed very nice, i have yet to notice any actual difference in my skin compared to using an oil half the price.

And a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. It’s also the perfect oil to add into foundation without it getting your skin greasy. It has many purposes and I think it’s worth every penny!

Me: SUPER oily, scar easily, the second it seems like the existing cystic acne FINALLY starts disappearing, theres another few ready to take their place somewhere else, I wear light makeup because its not for me but im ashamed of my skin. I can't say I remember where I heard of this oil, but I decided to get a sample of it soon after I heard of it. The first two nights I washed my face, used a toner, slathered on a serum, a treatment and finished with this. I woke up both mornings feeling greasy. I decided on the next evening to give this a more honest try. So I washed my face, used a toner and used this oil. The next morning was skin was beautiful. **MY** skin was beautiful. I have struggled with cystic acne and textured skin and scars-- and I woke up with the cystic acne receding (not as large or painful) and despite the scars, my skin was smooth and healthy looking. Ive been using this over the last almost 2 weeks and (I only use at night) my days are super long -- 10-13 hours long depending on the day. Ill come home and remove my makeup and have one or two painful bumps developing beneath my skin. Ill do my aforementioned nightly routine and within a few hours, the painful bump is less painful, less pronounced/inflamed. My scars: I don't think this is an oil dedicated to reducing scar appearance, but over the time Ive been using this product with my simple routine, scars that should have lasted WAY longer and become WAY darker (because I have the awful habit of picking during high anxiety), are fading pretty darn fast in comparison to what Im accustom. I am completely in love with this oil. Im excited to see what else I can use from this line during the day and with makeup!

I am also a guy and anything with too much fragrance is not for me. I thought that the gel-cream version of this moisturizer would suit my combo-dehydrated, very acne-prone skin better, BUT after reading so many reviews of the gel-cream vs just the cream, I decided that this cream version would be the one to actual do something about my dehydration. I am so glad that I read the reviews, because it has been over 5 months now and this moisturizing cream has transformed my skin to have a thicker, stronger feel when washing my face and my breakouts have decreased sooooo much. I will continue to buy this cream for a while, just curious whether I will need it during the summer in San Diego. Def. recommend tho for anyone with finicky skin looking for a night time moisturizer.

Skin Type Dry",4 stars,"One great thing about this cream is that when I’m cleansing my face about 12-ish hours later, it’s still on my skin. Think about how your face feels immediately after your skincare routine. Smooth, bouncy, Soft? how long does that look and feel really last? It varies by weather, season, how dry oily or balanced your skin is individually doing .. but more than any moisturizer I can recall, this really works and lasts as that final, occlusive step. It is the end result of a small army of skincare potions, but with this moisturizer that bouncy look and petal-soft feel stays all day. I can’t say that about products twice the cost or twice as thick. I guess I’m being impossible, bc that’s also what’s wrong with this cream. If you are even leaning toward an oily skin day, this is going to make it worse. And as for wearing with makeup, I like a very dewy look, layering glossy-finish creams and opalescent primers, but they don’t melt into the skin on top of this. It’s one or the other, this cream with a simple bb, or skip it and use my ‘glass skin’ products. As for the claims of being youth activating and neurotransmitting (or something) I’m not going to tell you I look five years younger after going through a jar. I will say I’m happy with my skin, and this cream’s effects are better than most. Verdict? Better at night than day, winter than summer, dry than oily. Lasts an unusually long time, which is big selling point for very dry types and those who carry a mist at all times. Personally I have already switched to something different for the day, now that it’s summer, and am moving on to something new for night. Might buy again though. Good value btw. Most creams with this sophisticated texture and formulation are far more expensive.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I am now on my second container of the Essential Energy Moisturizing Cream and I have to say, this is now my favourite daily moisturizer. Efficacy: I have mild acne and combination skin. This cream absorbed well on my face and kept it moisturized. It even calmed down the redness from acne and the effect was overnight. This was probably my greatest surprise. Texture: I have tried the Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Cream (more gel-like than cream) and the Essential Energy Moisturizing Gel Cream. Both of these products resulted in a persistent patchy shine and stickiness. This cream went on matte and does not turn shiny. My skin feels smooth and it does not feel like a heavy layer of film is on the surface. Ingredients: I wanted something without parabens and mineral oil. This checks the box. The only thing that may be a deal breaker for others is the clean floral fragrance. I find it pleasant, light, and not long lasting. However if you have a sensitivity to fragrance, this might not be for you. Most of Shiseido's products contain fragrance, so this is worth noting. Packaging: I think some people may find the packaging unnecessarily large relative to the amount of product. However, I like the way it sits in the hand. If I had to be critical, I would say that compared to the Benefiance line, it would be nice to see glass jars instead of plastic. Overall: This moisturizer checks all the boxes for me. I would happily repurchase this and I hope it stays in the product line for many years to come.

I was using the Chanel Hydra moisturizer and an Origins moisturizer when I realized the Chanel wasn’t moisturizing my skin and the Origins wasn’t heavy enough. I went to Sephora a week ago and was recommended this cream. I wasn’t looking for brightening or anything like that (I rely mainly on serums and sleep for that) but since using this cream my skin has been smoother and more hydrated and healthier looking. I deducted a star because while the container is a good size, it camouflages how little product is actually inside.

After using this product for nearly a month (every time I cleansed my face so ~2x a day) it’s done an excellent job keeping my face from going flaky with my makeup. A plus (idk if it can be called that lol) is that it’s keeping my stress wrinkles on my forehead at bay. Love it!

I’m always looking for a new moisturizer. This moisturizer is fragrant. And I don’t know if I’m crazy, but it doesn’t dissipate. I can smell this for hours. I’ve heard some people say it smells the same as the ibuki line, and also don’t really like their ibuki night mask.. so there’s that. Maybe I don’t like that smell. If a cream is effective, I don’t mind the smell. But, I noticed no difference with my skin after 3 weeks of twice daily usage. I felt like I was rubbing fragrance on my face. I like my moisturizers to moisturize, and make me feel hydrated and refreshed. This left my skin smelling clean.. and kind of tight. More or less, I didn’t like the smell or the end result. That being said, I know shiseido likes to add fragrance (not for me), and likes their product to settle quickly and not stay tacky. A lot of their stuff has a lot of alcohol in it and I find that it doesn’t agree with me. .. If you like their ibuki line, or their message.. GO FOR IT! I honestly feel I wasn’t the right person for this moisturizer. If you’re full on oily, and fragrance doesn’t bother you I feel like this could be a good fit.

This is a beautiful moisturizer for anyone with any type of skin but with oily I would be a little careful. I’m oily and I could feel this one my skin through out the day but it gives me such a beautiful youthful glow I could care less! I wear it under my super matte foundations so I don’t feel as “tight” on my face and so my texture isn’t so pronounced. Otherwise I would recommend more of a gel/light weight moisturizer is you want to wear something radiant because my foundation would move around a lot more. This is definitely made for people with dry and/or aging skin. It hydrated and leaves a beautiful glow!

I picked this up in-store, after having to exchange the Herbivore “Pink Cloud Rosewater Moisture Créme” — which left my skin somewhat flaky after application. I have naturally oily skin, so my preference in a moisturizer was to find something light and that won’t cause my skin to be even oilier. So far, after about a week of use, I can say that I really much prefer this product over the Herbivore cream; lightly fragranced, awesome consistency, it leaves a smooth, almost matte-type finish — which is perfect for those “no makeup” kinda days. And because a little goes a long way, I was told this size should last me about 7-8 months.

I’m currently pregnant, and my skin has become extremely dry and sensitive. I started getting all these little colorless bumps on my forehead, which my OB said were clogged pores due to hormonal changes, and I’ve tried SO many things without success to get rid of them. YTTP interested me because they’re a more natural, clean brand. I started out with their adaptogen moisture face cream, and that helped a lot with the dryness and redness, but I still felt like I needed more. After reading reviews on how well this adaptogen spray compliments the moisturizer, I decided to give it a try. THE LITTLE BUMPS ON MY FOREHEAD ARE ALL GONE!! I’m literally in shock. This spray is the only thing I’ve changed in my routine in weeks, and within 2 days my face is better than ever. I’ve never been confident going without foundation or BB cream, and this spray paired with the adaptogen moisturizer has made my skin look and feel calm, hydrated, and glowy. The acne like bumps are gone, my redness is pretty much gone, and I’ve never had such flawless looking skin in my life. And the mist is so, so refreshing, it truly feels like heaven spritzing it on your face. If you’re like me, I’m skeptical of reviews where people received a free product, because I’m worried they’re not as honest. Well, I didn’t receive this product for free, I paid full price, and I’m still raving about it because it’s just THAT GOOD. I never knew one product alone could make such an amazing world of difference, and I’m in love.

The first thing I notice about this mist is that it comes out in such an amazingly fine true mist. A lot of products don't accomplish this and it's really a spray - that's not the case here. This is the finest mist ever and it's awesome! When it hits your skin, it disappears almost instantly,... and feels so amazing! It's such a refreshing sensation that you just want to keep misting! (That's probably why I drain bottles of the stuff so quickly...) But here's the thing, it's recommended anytime you need to keep skin calm, hydrated or refreshed so.... spritz away, I say! It's got one of my all-time dry skin hydrators, Hyaluronic Acid, Peptides to soothe and adaptogens for your antioxidants. My skin drinks this up and has been feeling great since I've been using it. At $42 for a full bottle, it's not a bad deal since a bottle can last me 3-4 months or so.

Because my cheeks are dry, I usually start my application there and then work it through to the rest of my face. I actually feel like this moisturizer makes my skin less oily than most daily moisturizers I've tried with NO SPF. (I'm pushing 30 so, SPF is important to me at this point.) I did wear this under a full face of makeup this weekend and did not feel that it contributed to any accelerated or additional creasing, etc. All-in-all it's a good daily moisturizer but again - don't overdo it especially if you do have oily skin.

At the age of 28 I really wish someone would’ve helped me find a sunscreen earlier :( before the ones I tried smelled like sunscreen, made me shiny (even though I have dry skin), and sometimes had an off white shade for my darker skin. My biggest concern though was that they always clogged my pores and gave me pimples! That same day of the day later after wearing sunscreen I had a pimple. This 5 in 1 product did everything I was looking for and more. I’m obsessed. Only been wearing for a week but it moisturizes so we’ll leaving my skin soft. It doesn’t smell much like anything to me, so it’s fine with me, a slight pleasant scent if anything. It leaves such a nice glow that doesn’t seem to fade with the day unlike the oily look that other sunscreens would leave. It gives me a more even tone somehow and makes it look like I have a BB cream on. I’ve used it around my eyes without any problems and best of all no pimples!!! I think this product will be a favorite of my for decades. Very happy with this brand

I then bought a full-size container and I noticed the first time I put it on it didn't seem quite as creamy and luscious as the sample. It felt a bit thinner to the touch and seemed more fragrant. After two days of use I began breaking out around my temples and getting small bumps on my chin, nose and forehead. I rarely get any pimples or breakouts so I stopped using the cream and the spots went away. I wanted to be sure it was the cream, so i tried it again several weeks later with the same results. Bummer. While it may work for some, I can't recommend it.

Does not break me out or anything either. - cons: i have oily combination skin but still feel like this cream is too light for me. In the summer, i usually try to minimize my skin care routine by using just toner and moisturizer. That routine has worked out really well with other moisturizer, but not this one. This gel cream absorbs in your skin really quick and then leave your skin a dry feeling like you have not applied anything on your face. I think this cream only works for very oily skin.

I have had two of the worst breakout of my life, and those firming effects didn't hold up. The breakouts seem like they are cause by drying and irritation. Almost like the worlds tiniest cystic acne, as the spots are super small, but very clustered. My skin texture isn't even close to as nice as it was with the Black Tea mask. Needless to say I will not be buying this again, and don't know what to do with the rest of the jar (since a little does go a long way).

When I did the return in store, a lady behind me in line asked me if my skin broke out with this. I said yes and she said it had happened to her too! I have never had a product make me so itchy and absolutely red. The first two times I used it it was very moisturizing, it is too bad that after that was when my skin reacted in a big way.

No. But I do feel that if you were to use a moisturizer underneath this that is a humectant or even an emollient it would provide more hydration since this moisturizer is an occlusive. I will continue to use this until I finish it and possibly try it again next fall/winter with a gel cream or cream underneath it. What I did not see at all was any new firmness on my skin.

I like that it is unscented, easily absorbs in to the skin, non greasy or sticky. My skin feels soft and smooth after applying it to my facial skin such a great relief for the dry and dehydrated skin. This cream has hyaluronic acid so it helps minimize appearance of fine lines and wrinkle. I also liked the recyclable glass container it's very nice and environmental friendly. Highly recommended to others.

I think it probably wouldn’t work for oily skin types but for normal/dry, treat it as a serum after moisturizer and before foundation. It hydrates and preps my dry patches so foundation can apply smoother. Wait a few minutes if you’re concerned it will slip around too much.

It didn’t give me any irritation or allergic reactions which is a big plus, most products can. I also appreciate how unlike other thicker creams it doesn’t leave me looking greasy or too wet- it dries down almost matte and smooth. I wish it was a little more intense but I can supplement with a hyaluronic acid serum. Excited to see how this works under makeup!

Skin Type Combination",4 stars,"This is a great moisturizer for either day or nighttime use depending on the season and/or how dry your skin is. My skin is oily-combination and I find that this cream can be a bit too heavy and oily if I apply too much but a thin layer leaves a nice, glowy finish that still feels hydrating. It provides the perfect base for makeup and/or SPF and does not pill or interfere with the texture of the products being applied over it in any way. Another thing that I really like about this moisturizer (and the whole range of face creams) is that the finish remains exactly the same and does not become more dry or oily throughout the day, which is a major plus. The only reason I’m not giving this 5-stars is that while it feels very smooth and hydrating on and does its job as a moisturizer very well, I don’t feel like it does anything to actually improve the quality my skin whether it be anti-aging, redness or texture. For the price, I definitely expected more in terms of skin benefits/improvements. That said, it is the only moisturizer I’ve tried that a) maintains the same finish throughout the day and b) works perfectly under makeup and other products. I have used other creams that had more of an impact in terms of improving my skin/addressing a specific concerns but there was always a trade-off in terms of finish (i.e., too shiny) and/or compatibility with other products, so for that reason, I’ve been using the Sturm face creams as moisturizers exclusively for months (and have already repurchased) while relying on other products to target specific skin concerns. So if you are looking for a moisturizer that will actually improve your skin, this might be disappointing. But if you are already have a routine full off various treatments/serums and are just looking for something that will provide hydration, maintain its finish throughout the day and wear well under makeup, this is a solid choice.

I like that it doesn't leave a sticky residue and that it settles into my skin quickly as opposed to my Clinique moisturizer, which I feel needs like 20 minutes to soak in before I can even think of makeup. Had to take one star off for the pump which releases a TINY amount of product. I'm very conservative in my product use, but I'm using five pumps for my face and neck. FIVE. I want to try something heavier for night, but this is a great daytime moisturizer at a great price point.

At 1st I was using the 3D day facial in the morning and at night before going to bed (since the review for the 3D night facial weren't that great, I didn't buy it). But I got much, much better results using the cream during the day, and the oil at night. I don't know how they work, but they really do. I really hope they never change the formula or discontinue both products, especially the oil. I had minor sagging along my jawline, and tried multiple creams and serums, nuface, rollers and sha gua with little to no results. I was considering going back to fillers and thredlift which had worked for me before when my sagging was worse, but of course fillers and threads are very expensive and last only about a year. So after reading all of the amazing reviews, I bought the cream and oil, hoping I could return them if they don't work. I honestly didn't think creams or oil could give such amazing results, considering I tried much more expensive products before from La Prarie, La Mer, etc, that barely worked.

I have tried more expensive night creams than this and this is still my favorite. It is an underrated product but nonetheless amazing! the consistency is soooo cushiony. You can literally poke the cream all way through the bottom of jar with your finger and the next day the dent in cream will be gone and completely filled with the cream. This is how it feels on the skin as well! It makes your skin super plump and it absorbs so fast! super hydrating, non-irritating. I have seen some improvement of lines on forehead. I think with continue used skin will continue to improve. Again I have used this for a little bit over 3months and I'm still 3/4 of a jar left! you only need very little.

Now that I'm approaching 30 and my forehead wrinkles are getting deeper I've been on a hunt for a good night cream that helps diminish them while also solving my millions of other skincare problems (texture, redness, pores, oily yet dry) and I kept striking out product after product. I've tried everything without even blinking about the price point. This. Is. It. I woke up the first day after using it with my skin feeling plump dewy and beautiful. I had less redness, my normally texturized skin was virtually flawless, and my forehead wrinkles (though not completely erased) looked like they did 6 years ago when I VERY first started to notice them. I can't stop touching my face when I wake up it feels so incredibly soft. I've been using it in conjunction with a personal microdermabrasion device and it looks like I get facials on the reg, when in reality I haven't had a facial in about 4 years. If you're thinking about trying it JUST GO FOR IT. I honestly can't even believe how affordable it is for the results you get. Hands down best night cream I've ever used, and that's including La Mer.

I sampled the blue Water Bank sleep mask before deciding to purchase this one after reading reviews. I've been using this one for a few weeks now and the smile lines and forehead wrinkles I've been starting to develop have been softening and aren't as noticeable as they were before I started using this. I actually noticed a difference in them after the first night. The instructions suggest using it twice a week but I use it every night and haven't had any issues. If you're trying to decide between this one and the blue Water Bank sleep mask, keep in mind that the instructions on the blue mask ask you to apply a separate moisturizer before using it and this one doesn't. That kind of makes up for the $14 price difference in my opinion. They are equally as moisturizing but I do feel like this one helps with anti-aging better. I will be repurchase this.

Skin Type Oily",5 stars,"I LOVE THIS ! I really really do !!! So I have oily skin, well combination oily, acne prone skin and I adore this. I know some people with acne have said they don’t like this but for me this doesn’t cause me any acne issues at all and it also doesn’t make my skin oily so I think even oily girls can use this. Now for why I love this, it is SUPER hydrating ! Which is actually great for oily skin. Oily skin is just a response to skin that’s actually dehydrated so the more hydration you add to your skin the less oil it will produce, I’ve found this to be the case with this lovely moisturizer. Another reason I love it is because it gives your skin a bit of a glow/dew which I kind of have been more into lately. Last thing that’s great about this is that it can actually double as a primer, idk what it is but it’s so hydrating I guess that foundation looks great on top of it. If I do ever put this on and feel like my skin has a little too much dew before my foundation I’ll just blot with a tissue before applying my foundation. I adore this. I’ve been using it for 6 months and have repurchased and will continue too, it’s AMAZING !

I experienced no irritation, break outs, or peeling. This product delivers retinol results without the irritation. However, the seams on the end of my tube began to open a few days ago. I don't know why this is. Perhaps the adhesive that is meant to keep it together isn't strong enough, but that's a definite downside to the product, and for $55 I expect better. Retinol breaks down when routinely exposed to air. It's not harmful, but it does become less effective. Maybe I was just unlucky, but I think this is something people should be aware of. If it wasn’t for that issue, I’d give the product 5 stars otherwise.

The first time I experienced a lot of peeling on the second day after using. Although I read the instructions about the peeling being a part of the process, I still had that natural reaction that “oh no, this product isn’t working out for me!” But after some intense skincare hydration for the following days, the peeling reduced and I definitely noticed improvements in my skin texture. I have some texture around my cheekbones and it has reduced to where I hardly notice it.

I recently decided to make a switch to using primarily oil cleansers, and had to spend so much time looking for one that doesn't contain a plethora of unnecessary and/or negative ingredients that I was almost tempted to just diy it (wouldn't have ended well, that much is sure). Thankfully, I finally found this one, and I would definitely recommend this cleanser over most other brands' oil cleansers. The four main oils this includes in its ingredients are all relatively low on the comedogenic scale, which, nice. It does have added fragrance, which is unfortunate, but otherwise fits all my wants. I don't wear a lot of makeup, but what I do wear (a little concealer, eyeshadow) it melts off perfectly. On days when I don't wear makeup I just use this on its own. Two to three pumps dispenses just the right amount of product. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, and with none of the tight, dry sensation you might get from many foaming cleansers. I have combination skin with easily clogged pores, especially on my forehead, and so far this hasn't broken me out from daily use. I'm very happy with this product.

The oil had a thicker consistency than I was used to, so that is why I had to knock off a star. I felt that I had to use more pressure (and i'm trying to prevent premature aging) on my skin to work the product in to break down my makeup. It did an excellent job at breaking down my makeup and sunscreen and it emulsified well with water. I did feel like there was a slight residue afterwards, but I do a double cleanse so it did not bother me too much. The packaging is cute but it would have been nicer if the bottle was not opaque so you could see exactly when you were going to run out. The price was pretty decent for the amount you received.

Skin Type Dry",5 stars,"I just switched to an oil-based cleanser, and selected this one based on it’s ingredients. Unlike most others on Sephora, this does not include essential oils (fragrant plant oils), which may be considered “clean” by whoever sets those standards but are actually extremely bad for your skin...it’s nothing but marketing and bad science to add them to face care products, they are every bit as inflammatory and cytotoxic as synthetic fragrance. THIS stuff is incredible. Leaves my skin so soft and does deeply cleanse without stripping. I tested it by wiping a cotton pad with toner after cleaning on a day I wore a “full face” and it came back spotless. I trust the ingredients and the results! The ingredients are simple, oils and emulsifiers (latter is reason it rinses off easily, taking the oily gunk with it) and I have seen a huge improvement in my skin.

Im not sure how this will behave on oily skin, but if you have combo skin or dry skin I would definitely reccomend. For The record, I currently have dehydrated skin which is different then dry skin. Dehydrated skin gets oily on the outside because your skin is trying to overcompensate for being so dry, but underneath the layer of oil is dry flaky skin. Most likely from not eating/drinking properly in my case. A few minutes after applying this moisturizer , I could tell it was high quality. Usually facial moisturizers temporarily moisturize the outside of my skin and then evaporate. However, This moisturizer really penetrated ALL the layers of my skin. My skin felt smooth and supple from the inside out. I wore as a base before my primer then applied liquid foundation. This really helps lock in moisture. This was in the spring so I can’t imagine how great this product would be in the winter! I normally have to touch up around lunch time. Wiping my whole face away and starting from scratch because I get dry flakes or my makeup either starts caking or sliding or a combination of both. (Ugh) I did not have to touch up once when I wear this. Makeup will never be perfect all day, but this was close. I wore as a base, then applied Smashbox primer, then a mix of bb cream and liquid foundation. I’m not sure if it was this alone or if these products were a magic combo, but my skin looked so glowy healthy and nice when I wore this. My skin was mosturized and stayed hydrated for many hours. I emphasize HYDRATED NOT GREASY. This was my first experience with this brand and a pleasant one. I hope to experiment and buy a few more of their products to enjoy.

It’s pretty much dry all the time except winter time when it rains little bit. I recently visited S. Korea when it was extremely cold like 4degree in Fahrenheit. But I was good to go outside because my skin was armed and moisturized with the cream. I’m in mid 40s. Some ladies are complaining about the cream being too greasy but I’ve no problem. Maybe women under 40 aren’t ready for this. Also little amount of cream goes long to keep my skin hydrates and gives nice dewy glowing look.

The rose absolut fragrance is also a must have for your face regimen. I've been using this product at night before bed and my face smells amazing all day long too, and so does my pillow!

However, after using this product my skin is firmer, more moisturized, hydrated, and radiant looking. I can't believe the difference. Just a small amount of this product goes a long way. I use about a pea size and it covers my entire face, jawline, and neck. The consistency of this cream is thick and rich. It can tend to be greasy if you apply too much. After application, my skin immediately feels so soft. Unlike other moisturizers I have tried, SK-II Ultimate Revival Cream is long lasting. This products claims to keep moisture locked in for 12 hours. I definitely agree with this claim. Overall, I really love SK-II Ultimate Revival Cream. It makes my skin look and feel amazing with very little effort. The only drawback to this product is the price. $385 is a considerable amount of money to spend on a facial cream. However, I have tried numerous products over the years trying to combat my dry skin with little or no results. I can honestly say that this product has changed my skin for the better. Hydration, firmness, and radiant looking skin. What more can a woman in her early 40's ask for?!

Gorgeous jar: The SK-II LXP comes in a beautiful rose gold jar which looks absolutely classy and beautiful. It also comes with a dipper and stand for it, which I think is a very useful tool since it keeps the product sanitary. 2. Smells delicious: The SK-II LXP has a very slight rose scent which makes application almost luxurious. And thats where the positives end for me. On to the cons: 1. Greasy: As much as I wanted to like this product, its too greasy for me. It didnt get absorbed properly,it just sat on my skin, even when I used a pea-sized amount. 2. Unclear active ingredients: I some research on what the active ingredients for SK-II LXP are and I am still unsure. The product that I recognize the most is niacinamide, but then again I dont know in what concentration it is present. The info should be readily available since there are products with the same ingredients available for 1/15 of the price. 3. Exorbitant price: No matter how I put it, SK-II LXP is way too expensive for a middle class salary. A jar might last up to 3 , may be 4 months if used sparingly. Replacing it at that rate,would cost almost $2000 annually.SK-II LXP would have to be a miracle product in order to justify those kind of costs, which unfortunately it is not.

Due to how emollient the product is, I've found that rubbing my hands together to heat up my palms before applying the moisturizer helps it to sink into my skin.

I have used this product for about a month and have noticed that my skin is hydrated and brighter. My makeup application looks so even and bright. I only use the moisturizer at night only and I have a nice dewy look the next day. I have not noticed any changes in my dark spots or wrinkles so far but the other results are amazing. My daughter, who I see once every few months, came for a visit and told me that my skin looked great. I told her what I was using and she said it looked so smooth. She is in her early 20s and I gave her a sample to take home. She said that her skin is looking great too. I really struggle with the price although the sample is full size but I feel it will last for 4 to 6 months or more.

Skin Type Normal",5 stars,"I'm going to give SK-II LXP Ultimate Revival Cream five stars after I've been using it twice daily for about three weeks. This is a very thick cream, so be warned about this ahead of time! If you just need light moisture, you may not enjoy the drenching this cream does to your skin! I only recently started to feel like I was starting to get saggy in certain spots, so I feel like I am late to the anti-wrinkle game. However, I know a good beauty product when I try one, and this is one of them! The cream is very thick, so much so that you will be ahead of the game if you put a small amount in your palm and allow it to melt a little from your body heat before applying to your face. This is one of those products that seems to have several functions covered in one step. It is a moisturizer that truly will keep your face plump with moisture even longer than the promised 12 hours, it has great anti-wrinkle ingredients that go to work while you wear it, and it does a fantastic job of filling in fine lines (because it's so hydrating or because of the ingredients or both - I have no idea!) This cream leaves your skin very soft and, once the cream is absorbed, silky smooth. I find that it serves as a great base for other makeup items, such as bronzer and blush. No need for a primer! And this smells absolutely amazing, so despite all of the chemical-sounding ingredients, you smell roses on your face!!!! I really like this cream and will be continuing to use this as my day and night cream from now on. The name says it all - this revives tired, dry skin!

4861,Binreddy,3 stars,"I recently received this product as part of a promotion and was very interested/excited about trying it out. I have been looking for a really good moisturizer for a while now. I wanted to use this for awhile so I can give an honest review of this product. I have to say right off the back, the packaging is so beautiful. Although most of my cosmetics/facial care products are usually hidden away in my drawers/medicine cabinet, this product has found a home right next to the toothbrush and face cleaner, ""very counter space-worthy"". But the main question remains, does it work? Does it do all it claims to do? In a nutshell, it does. One negative is that it doesn't come with clear instructions, so I had to look up exactly how to use it and how much to use and what exactly is that stick thing? Which by the way is an stick/spatula to use while applying said product, so that you don't have to stick your fingers in it.which I very much appreciate. A plus for those germaphobes out there. But clearer instructions would be very helpful. As for the product itself, I didn't really pick up that rose scent that it claims to have, but that is fine. I tend to prefer products without too much of a scent. It is very thick and creamy. I was worried that it would be very heavy and leave my skin feeling very oily. But since you only need a pearl sized amount, it is just enough to give your skin the moisture it needs without leaving your skin feeling like you just washed it in a vat of oil. And the moisture does last and there is no need to reapply. I have been using it as part of my nightly skin care routine and I have found that the size my pores have diminished and that my skin no longer has that tight and dry feeling it tends to get. The skin as whole feels firmer, as well. Although they recommend using it morning and night, I only use at night because I prefer a lighter moisturizer during the day. The main negative is the price. I have very mixed feelings, about this product. On one hand, I do love the results but I don't think I can really spend nor justify spending a couple hundred dollars on just one product.

You only need a tiny dollop once per day. If you have extra extra dry skin, use this in the morning. If it's slightly dry to combo or oily, then I'd recommend putting it on at night before bed then can wash off the leftover moisture in the morning. It smooths wrinkles, hydrated dry skin, reduced age spots etc. Very impressed. It has a slight rose scent to it so if you aren't a fan of roses this might not be for you.

Skin Type Combination",5 stars,"I'm Asian, and in many Asian countries, SK-II is considered the queen of skin care. I've used many of their products, and all of them have performed beyond my expectation. My favorite product has always been their facial treatment essence. We literally call it ""the magical water"" in Asia. SK-II Ultimate Revival Cream is the first facial moisturizer product I've ever tried from SK-II. The reason why I waited so long to try this out is the price tag, as you may see the price tag on this product is a bit intimidating. However, after using this cream for the past 4 weeks, I can truly say this is the most luxurious cream I've ever used. I have very sensitive rosacea skin and I usually steer away from scented products, but this SK-II Ultimate Revival Cream has the most beautiful and genuine rose scent in skin care products. It's light and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. This facial cream also seems to balance my skin as well, no more dry patches and oily T-zone. My whole face is moisturized but not greasy, and it works wonderfully under my full face of makeup. I use it day and night but a little goes a long way, so this jar should last you a while. Many people have noticed my skin tone being more even, and this is the only new product I added to my skin care routine recently, so I know it's working. I just turned 30 and have no visible fine lines yet so I can't comment on the effect of anti-aging, but I find my skin looking energized and soft, which does make my skin look more youthful. I'd definitely repurchase and would recommend SK-II Ultimate Revival Cream to every one that wants to pamper their skin. It's truly a treat to use this facial cream. *I received this product from SK-II in exchange for my honest opinion.""

4866,Lipstick72,4 stars,"This cream reminds me of the old school Elizabeth Arden night creams my mom used, the thing about this product is we aren't in1982 and it isn't necessary to have a heavier cream. I'm an Aesthetician, over 40 and I honestly do not like the feel of this cream. It's too heavy and it looks and feels greasy on my skin. If you use a smaller amount on a wet face it becomes easier to ware and absorb. I feel this maybe good for a very dry and mature skin, but not for an average or combination skin. It did work in hydration and I did see a small difference in appearance of surface fine lines. But for the price it wasn't worth it for me. But keep in mind that everyone has different reactions so this may work and be the perfect cream for you. Just make sure you prefer a heavier feel to your products!

When I used it in the mornings I'd have to plan ahead to get other things done while the cream was sinks by in. Otherwise when I did my makeup immediately after applying the cream i looked way too dewy and I'd have to apply another layer of powder. So I think if you have dry skin and/or like a dewy look this cream could be for you. I received this product for free in exchange for this review.

First of all there is a mellow scent to it so if you are sensitive to perfumes like me then this should be great for you. Also, it blended instantly and did not leave a greasy feeling on my face. After a few days of use I really noticed a difference to my skin.....even my tiny line of sweat pimples on my forehead seemed to disappear. One more thing.....I have always hated wearing lotion on my face in the summer because I feel like it makes me feel and sweat more but this was not the case. I did not feel like lotion was dripping into my eyes. The overall look & feel of my skin definitely improved. I highly recommend this product.

The price tag is very intimidating and I would be reluctant to purchase without sampling first, however after using the product just a few days I noticed a major change in my skin. I turned 40 this year and have been noticing my skin looking dull, aging and breaking out more. After a week using the product my skin looked calm and more evenly toned. After two weeks it looked clear, brighter and my fine lines more refined. I have been using the product for over a month now and I could not be more happy with the results. I have to say it is a splurge but SO worth it!! My skin looks amazing! New products usually make me break out but I have not with this. My skin looks fresh and younger!! The cream is so rich and luxurious and a little goes a long way. The smell is amazing, like roses, and the rose gold packaging and applicator is beautiful! I use every night and days that I do not wear makeup and I have to say there are more of those since looks so good!! I feel like I am having a spa experience every evening after applying the cream. I highly recommend this product to any women looking to treat herself.

I was using all the moisturizers, a clean/healthy skin regiment and was thinking I would have to go to the dermatologist. However, since using this product those bumps on my face have completely gone away and the texture of my skin has transformed and is so smooth & hydrated. This water essence is amazing and saved me a trip to the derma for what I didn’t realize was just extremely dry skin. If you have dry skin, don’t hesitate to add this to your skincare routine after toner and before other moisturizers - I hope it helps you as it did me :)

I just started using a Mamonde toner for the past 2 weeks and love it but toners aren’t necessary for skin care routine, I just got it as a sample! I received this in my Allure box and checked the ingredients on it right away. I have sensitive skin, so I am limited to what I can use and you would not believe how many skin care companies put chemicals and cheap junk into. I was surprised by the ingredients list! It is all amazing ingredients! It contains some that I have never tried before. I cleansed my face, toned and applied this before my moisturizer. It sinks deeply into my pores and does NOT leave any residue behind! It also did not break me out AT ALL. It’s actually feels therapeutic to use, in my opinion. Now if I don’t use it in conjunction with my moisturizer, my face feels very tight and a little dry. I love this essence and I plan to buy a full size bottle when I run out of this one!! Definitely recommend because if it works for me-it’ll work for anyone!

It feels effective due to the concentration. My skin needed more of a break between uses to get used to this, although I’ve used retinols before. The scent is minimal. Honestly I feel like the jury is still out with this product for me. Living in a dry desert climate I think a serum would be better. Also the packaging feels kinda cheap for the price of the product.

I have sensitive skin so I use it every other day. I would definitely purchase and plan to when this bottle runs out. I was sent this product to test by Influenster.

Her skin was flawless so when I noticed Sephora carried it, I decided to give it a try. I originally purchased the NutriPerfect Day Cream with Sunscreen and fell in love with it...so I bought the NIght Cream a week later. I am in deep love with this product! While on the pricey side, I can notice a HUGE difference in my skin! It is not so heavy that it clogs your pores (I am VERY sensitive to breaking out) but it does provide plenty of hydration while you sleep. I only rated the product 4 stars because of the price.

After suffering with contact dermatitis on my lips for the last year and a half (to which me and my dermatologist still cannot figure out), this salve gives me much needed relief! I have changed my entire skincare routine, stopped wearing lipstick/lipgloss, switched to hypoallergenic toothpaste, I've even gone so far as to stop using the water from my sink and stopped kissing my pet parrot thinking that one of those things may be the culprit; alas, to no avail. I have tried multiple prescriptions and steroid creams that sting, make my lips peel off in sheets, or make them feel like leather, and I had had enough. I wanted to find something healthier and more homeopathic, and this is it! I will admit that I still have trouble with flare ups on the boarders of my lips, but using this in combination with their Lip Savior (not sold at sephora- you have to buy it from the skinfix websitee) have made my lips FINALLY feel like soft, supple lips again! As soon as I feel a flare up coming, I dab a little of this on, and it takes it away within minutes. I am so thankful and relieved to have found this line. I even bought the barrier lip gloss to use in between my flare ups, and I love that product too!

It’s affordable, convenient & besides the fact that it’s a perfect traveling size; it’s full of multiple uses. My top 3 ways to use this #facialspray by Mario Badescu is I. After I cleanse my face (I spray on before I apply either a essence or a nightly mask) II. Middle of the day as the BEST pick me up! (Store I the fridge for an extra fresh sensation!) III. Before I apply makeup ( a pre primer/prep spray) I know there are (now) at least 3 options of scent combinations, but the Aloe/Cucumber/Green Tea is the OG. Why mess with perfection?!

I was dissapointed, it didn't give any hydration to the face (am normal skin type on a slightly dry side), in fact it was quite drying, and I tried it in summer time and fall... Maybe because of peppermint (which i didn't know it contains - myy bad), however overall the product is average at best, drying, sticky and with unpleasant scent. There are many other alternatives, don't waste your money

I gave it 3 stars because it was an OK hydrator for me for summer, but if you're looking for a noticable reduction of fine lines, you'll probably be disappointed. It seems to act more like a primer, filling in fine lines for a period of time vs actually improving skin texture to reduce the appearance of the lines.

Using this cream which by the way is smooth as butter on my skin, it really helped it be softer and appear less aging than without using it. My wrinkles around my nose, mouth and forehead appears to have went dramatically down and they look so soft and the cream is so amazing... I don't know what else to say about how it works so well for me. I feel it's really helped with the moisturizing almost a plump skin appearance.
